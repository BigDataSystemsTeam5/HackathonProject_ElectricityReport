However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor.

Demand is forecast to rise by an average annual 4.6% from 2024 to 2026, with China expected to provide close to 70% of growth in the region by 2026. Asia Pacific, which accounts for just over 50% of global electricity consumption, will see renewables share of power generation rise from 27% to 35% in 2026 but coal-fired power remains the major source of supply. In 2023, coal accounted for 57% of the region's electricity generation, with lowcarbon sources such as nuclear, hydro, solar and wind contributing for 32% of the mix.  Due  to  its  strong  reliance  on  coal  for  power,  Asia  Pacific  has  the  highest electricity generation CO2 intensity of our analysed regions, at 590 g CO2/kWh in 2023, compared to a global average of 455 g CO2/kWh. The region's emissions from electricity generation are expected to record slight increases of 0.2% in 20252026, after a decline in 2024 due to an assumed recovery in hydropower.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Malaysia  is  driving  electrification of its transport  sector  and  strengthening co-operation with neighbouring countries as part of the National Energy Transition Roadmap. Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the country's largest utility, is working with various  stakeholders  on  developing  500 MW  Large-Scale  Solar  Parks  (LSSP), 2.5 GW  Hybrid  Hydro-Floating  Solar  (HHFS),  and  co-firing hydrogen  and ammonia projects to diversify its energy portfolio and progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore, 2021-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The  gains  largely  reflect  high household consumption and public spending on infrastructure and social services. As a result, electricity demand posted strong growth of about 4% in 2023, and is forecast at a higher annual average rate of 6% from 2024-2026, underpinned by continued robust economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: . Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.    However,  the  per  capita  electricity consumption of households in China is still below the average for EU households.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union , following a 3.1% decline in 2022, electricity demand fell by  a  further  3.2%  in  2023.  We  anticipate  a  return  to  growth  in  2024  of  1.8%, assuming a partial recovery in the industry sector given more moderate energy prices and expanding electrification of the transportation and heating sectors. EU electricity  demand is forecast to grow on average by 2.5% annually during the\n\n2025-2026 period, supported by an improved economic outlook. Nevertheless, following  the  record  demand  contraction  in  the  European  Union  last  year, uncertainties surround over how much of this decline is temporary and how much is structural.\n\n## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\nIn  China,  the  post-pandemic  economic  recovery  paved  the  way  for  a  strong increase in  electricity  demand  of  6.4%  in  2023,  with  the  services  and  industry sectors  experiencing  the  most  robust  rebound.  With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

However, we expect average annual demand growth of slightly  below 1% for 2024 to 2026. The peak electricity demand for the entire power system surpassed 100 GW for the first time in history on 7 August, reaching 100.8 GW.\n\nIn  2023,  the  country's  total  power  capacity  increased  by  7 GW.  This  included nuclear (1.4 GW) as well as coal-fired (1.1 GW), gas-fired (2 GW), and renewable energy (3.8 GW) capacity. In 2024, further capacity additions are expected for nuclear (1.4 GW), coal-fired (1.1 GW), gas-fired (0.7 GW) and renewable energy (4.1 GW).\n\nCoal is the mainstay of Korea's electricity system, accounting for about one-third of the total generation in 2023. However, coal power plant capacity is expected to gradually decrease to 2026, with plans to convert seven coal-fired power plants to gas-fired plants, with a total capacity of 3.6 GW. Nuclear capacity is forecast to increase from about 25 GW in 2022 to 29 GW in 2026, with no plans to retire any nuclear power plants in the latest plan. The share of renewable energy and nuclear power in the generation inches higher, while coal and LNG post marginal declines\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: | Mt CO2          | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2026   | Growth  rate  2021- 2022   | Growth  rate  2022- 2023   | CAAGR 2023- 2026   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|\n| Total emissions | 13 263 | 13 448 | 13 575 | 13 111 | 1.4%                       | 0.9%                       | -1.2%              |\n\n## Breakdown of Asia Pacific electricity supply and emissions, 2021-2026\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Southeast Asia is  another region with new coal-fired capacities coming online amid significant demand growth. Coal-fired generation is set to increase each year on average about 4% out to 2026.

In other parts of Asia, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan , new coal plants are coming online, with coal-fired generation forecast to record average annual growth rates of 18% and 6%, respectively, from 2024 to 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation by source in Asia, 2021-2026\n\nNote: Other non-renewables includes oil, waste and other non-renewable energy sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spotlight: Nuclear generation will reach a new record high by 2025\n\nBetween 2024 and 2026, an additional 29 GW of new nuclear capacity is expected to come online globally, more than half of them in China and India. With new plants starting  commercial  operation  in  various  regions,  as  well  as  French  nuclear recovery and expected restarts in Japan, we forecast global nuclear generation will be almost 10% higher in 2026 compared to 2023.

While the economic growth slowed down from the 2022 highs of a GDP growth of above 8%, economy is estimated to have grown robustly by almost 4%,  which  supported  electricity demand.  The  completion  of  several  new\n\nsemiconductor plants and data centre investments in 2024 are expected to boost electricity demand in the following years.

Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

This highlights the massive potential and need for additional electricity supply in this region. Our forecast for Africa for the period 2024-2026 anticipates an average annual growth in total electricity demand of 4%, more than double  the  mean  growth  rate  observed  over  2015-2023.  Around  60%  of  this\n\ngrowth in demand is to be met by expanding renewables, the remaining mostly by natural gas. Renewable generation in Africa has grown on average by 5% in 20152023. We forecast an average of 10% growth in renewable generation out to 2026 in Africa, as deployment of renewables gathers pace. Nevertheless, In order to achieve the region's energy development and climate targets, energy investments will have to more than double from today's USD 90 billion by 2030, with almost two-thirds of this spending going towards clean energy.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: The Philippines is targeting 35% renewables in its electricity mix by 2030. In 2023, the share sat at around 23%, and it is forecast to grow by close to 8% per year on average  from  2024-2026,  bringing  its  share  in  electricity  to  25%  in  the  same period.  This  increase  is  mostly  driven  by  solar  and  wind,  whose  share  in  the electricity mix more than doubles from 3% in 2023 to 7% in 2026. Measures in place to support growth in renewables include the Green Energy Option Program, which  enables  consumers  with  sufficient  load  and  metering  to  directly  procure renewables,  and  allowing  100%  foreign  ownership  of  renewable  assets,  since December 2022.\n\n## Singapore\n\n## Significant progress in the approval of the planned regional interconnection projects was achieved\n\nSingapore's electricity demand rose by less than 0.5% in 2023, down from 2% in 2022. For 2024-2026, we expect demand to increase by an average 2%, in line with economic growth. EVs will account for an increasing share of new electricity demand,  with  the  country  planning  to  phase  out  the  purchase  of  combustion vehicles by 2030.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China\n\nEgypt\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nKenya\n\nMorocco\n\nSenegal\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThailand\n\nUkraine\n\nThe European Commission also participates in the work of the IEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abstract\n\nElectricity is central to the functioning of modern societies and economies - and its  importance  is  only  growing  as  technologies  that  run  on  electricity,  such  as electric vehicles and heat pumps, become increasingly popular. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Turkmenistan exports electricity to Afghanistan, Iran,  Kyrgyzstan  and  Uzbekistan.  Turkmenistan  started  electricity  exports  to Kyrgyzstan in August 2021 and deliveries reached 1.6 TWh in 2023. In October 2022,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  agreed  to  ramp  up  electricity  supplies  to 4 TWh/yr, which could improve electricity supply security in Uzbekistan.\n\nIn Azerbaijan , electricity demand growth is estimated to have eased to 1% in 2023 from  more  than  4%  in  2022,  marking  a  further  slowdown  compared  to  the  7% rebound recorded in 2021. The country's electricity system is almost exclusively gas-fired  powered.  Fossil-fired  thermal  generation  remained  stable  in  2023,  as renewables continued to  increase.  Hydropower output  rose  by  15%,  while  wind\n\ngeneration fell by 30%. Solar power generation rose by 30%. Overall, the share of renewables in Azerbaijan's power remained broadly stable at around 6%.\n\nElectricity demand in Eurasia excluding Kazakhstan and Russia is expected to rise at an average growth rate of 3.5% per year in the 2024-2026 period. This will be largely  supported  by  the  region's  rising  population  and  economic  expansion, although  the  macroeconomic  outlook  has  worsened  since  Russia's  invasion  of Ukraine.\n\n## Middle East\n\n## Natural gas-fired generation continues to grow, but renewables gather pace\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: | Emissions: CO2 from electricity sector entering a structural decline ........  61                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| China accounts for half of the decline in global power generation emissions to 2026 ............ 61                                                                                                                                                |\n| China, the United States and European Union lead declines in power sector emissions ....... 62                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Emission intensity of the power sector to fall at an unprecedented rate.................................. 63                                                                                                                                       |\n| Prices: Wholesale electricity prices fall from record highs ........................  65                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Electricity prices in many regions still remain above pre-pandemic levels .............................. 65                                                                                                                                        |\n| What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world? ............................. 69                                                                                                                                         |\n| Household electricity prices and affordability  ........................................................................... 73                                                                                                                     |\n| Reliability: Monitoring electricity security remains essential .....................  76                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Specific measures and markets for system inertia are becoming common ............................ 76                                                                                                                                               |\n| Extreme weather events caused large-scale power outages in 2023 ..................................... 78                                                                                                                                           |\n| Supply and grid issues led to major outages mostly in emerging and developing countries .. 80                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Regional focus ................................................................................  88                                                                                                                                                |\n| Asia Pacific  ......................................................................................................  88                                                                                                                           |\n| Americas  ........................................................................................................  110                                                                                                                            |\n| Europe  ............................................................................................................  121 Eurasia ...........................................................................................................  138 |\n| Middle East ....................................................................................................  142                                                                                                                              |\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In 2022, the state utility recorded a loss of VND 20.7 trillion (USD 874.5 million) due to rising fuel production prices. In the first half of 2023, the losses rose to more than VND 35.4 trillion (USD 1.46 billion), according to a report by the Ministry of Planning and Investment.\n\n## Thailand\n\n## Energy security concerns sharpen the focus on boosting domestic natural gas production to support gas-fired power generation\n\nElectricity  demand  in  Thailand  rose  by  around  3%  in  2023.  Natural  gas-fired generation  increased  by  almost  13%,  whereas  coal-fired  output  decreased  by 14%. Renewable generation grew by 3%. As a result, CO2 intensity of the power sector declined from 470 g CO2/kWh in 2022 to 452 g CO2/kWh.\n\nSupported by economic growth, electricity demand in Thailand is forecast to rise at an average annual rate of 3% from 2024 out to 2026. Growth is expected to be met by increased supply from coal, gas and renewables. Currently, gas supplies around 65% of the electricity mix, coal 18% and renewables 17%. By 2026, the\n\nshare of coal is expected to rise by two percentage points while gas decreases by two percentage points, and renewables grow slightly. This corresponds to growth in both emissions and intensity through the forecast period.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Kazakhstan's  electricity  demand  is  forecast  to  grow  by  around  2.2%  per  year between 2024-2026, largely to be met by expanding gas-fired power generation. There are also plans for Russia's Inter RAO to construct three coal-fired power plants in Kazakhstan, which would be relevant outside our forecast period.\n\n## Other Eurasia\n\nFollowing the strong rebound in 2021 of 4%, electricity demand growth slowed in other Eurasian markets to an average of 3% per year in 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn Uzbekistan , preliminary data indicates that the country's electricity output rose by  3%  in  the  first  eleven  months  of  2023  compared  to  the  same  period  a  year before. Uzbekistan continued to expand its power generation capacities in 2023. Gas-fired generation accounted for just over 80% of power generation. The Shirin thermal power plant (1.5 GW) started operations in October 2023 and is expected to ramp-up to full operations in Q1 2024. According to the Ministry of Energy, around 1.5 GW  of  wind  and  solar  capacity  was  targeted  to  be  installed  in  2023.  The continued decline in natural gas production in Uzbekistan (down by 9.5% y-o-y in the first eleven months of 2023) continues to weigh on electricity supply security.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ongoing European energy crisis, created the surge. By 2023, prices were reduced by  around  NOK 1 000  compared  to  the  previous  year,  nevertheless  remaining 70% higher compared to 2019 levels.\n\n## Average household electricity prices in USD/MWh in purchasing power parity (PPP), 2019-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The strong expansion trend of renewables is expected to result in renewable generation growing by around 20% in 2024, assuming a recovery in hydropower, and 13% on average in 2025-2026, covering  all  the  additional  Chinese  demand  growth  and  suppressing  coal-fired output.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  weather  impact,  such  as  the  reduced hydropower due to droughts as observed in recent years, can cause an uptick in Chinese coal-fired generation in individual years. However, the overall trend of coal-fired  supply  being  restrained  and  replaced by  strong  growth  in  renewable energy sources (RES) is expected to remain largely stable.\n\nGiven India 's rapid increase in demand for electricity, coal-fired power generation is expected to rise by an average 2.5% annually in 2024-2026. At the same time, renewable generation will accelerate, with an average annual growth rate of 13% over the period.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Japan\n\n## Coal use in power generation is set to contract as nuclear and renewables ramp up\n\nIn  2023,  Japan's  electricity  demand  fell  by  3.7%  year-on-year  due  to  rising electricity  prices  and  concerted  energy  conservation  efforts.  The  impact  of weather  on  electricity  demand  was  mixed.  The  winter  months  of  2023  were significantly  milder,  with  -12%  heating  degree  days  (HDD)  compared  to  2022, reducing  electricity  demand.  At  the  same  time,  summer  was  hotter  at  +10% cooling degree days (CDD), supporting demand  for space cooling. The manufacturing sector contracted in 2023, according to purchasing managers index (PMI) trends, while at the same time services expanded year-on-year.\n\nThe spike in prices for energy commodities following Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted utilities to raise their rates. In June 2023, seven major utilities increased their regulated household rates by around 30% from previous levels. In response to the crisis, the Japanese government provided subsidies for electricity and gas bills in December 2022, and later extended this support until the spring of 2024.\n\nWe forecast a modest electricity demand growth at an average annual rate of around 0.5% from 2024 through 2026, supported by an assumed gradual recovery in the manufacturing sector as well as EV uptake. In 2023 the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) published its preliminary guidelines for EV chargers,\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinal electricity price\n\n- Compensation for indirect costs of EU ETS\n\nIEA.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Regional focus\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\n## Renewables meet growing share of electricity supply but coal remains the major source\n\nElectricity demand in Asia Pacific rose by 4.8% in 2023, and provided most of the additional growth in global electricity use. Demand is forecast to rise by an average annual 4.6% from 2024 to 2026, with China expected to provide close to 70% of growth in the region by 2026. Asia Pacific, which accounts for just over 50% of global electricity consumption, will see renewables share of power generation rise from 27% to 35% in 2026 but coal-fired power remains the major source of supply. In 2023, coal accounted for 57% of the region's electricity generation, with lowcarbon sources such as nuclear, hydro, solar and wind contributing for 32% of the mix.  Due  to  its  strong  reliance  on  coal  for  power,  Asia  Pacific  has  the  highest electricity generation CO2 intensity of our analysed regions, at 590 g CO2/kWh in 2023, compared to a global average of 455 g CO2/kWh. The region's emissions from electricity generation are expected to record slight increases of 0.2% in 20252026, after a decline in 2024 due to an assumed recovery in hydropower.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: .

The  gains  largely  reflect  high household consumption and public spending on infrastructure and social services. As a result, electricity demand posted strong growth of about 4% in 2023, and is forecast at a higher annual average rate of 6% from 2024-2026, underpinned by continued robust economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\nIn  China,  the  post-pandemic  economic  recovery  paved  the  way  for  a  strong increase in  electricity  demand  of  6.4%  in  2023,  with  the  services  and  industry sectors  experiencing  the  most  robust  rebound.  With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union , following a 3.1% decline in 2022, electricity demand fell by  a  further  3.2%  in  2023.  We  anticipate  a  return  to  growth  in  2024  of  1.8%, assuming a partial recovery in the industry sector given more moderate energy prices and expanding electrification of the transportation and heating sectors. EU electricity  demand is forecast to grow on average by 2.5% annually during the\n\n2025-2026 period, supported by an improved economic outlook. Nevertheless, following  the  record  demand  contraction  in  the  European  Union  last  year, uncertainties surround over how much of this decline is temporary and how much is structural.\n\n## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

However, we expect average annual demand growth of slightly  below 1% for 2024 to 2026. The peak electricity demand for the entire power system surpassed 100 GW for the first time in history on 7 August, reaching 100.8 GW.\n\nIn  2023,  the  country's  total  power  capacity  increased  by  7 GW.  This  included nuclear (1.4 GW) as well as coal-fired (1.1 GW), gas-fired (2 GW), and renewable energy (3.8 GW) capacity. In 2024, further capacity additions are expected for nuclear (1.4 GW), coal-fired (1.1 GW), gas-fired (0.7 GW) and renewable energy (4.1 GW).\n\nCoal is the mainstay of Korea's electricity system, accounting for about one-third of the total generation in 2023. However, coal power plant capacity is expected to gradually decrease to 2026, with plans to convert seven coal-fired power plants to gas-fired plants, with a total capacity of 3.6 GW. Nuclear capacity is forecast to increase from about 25 GW in 2022 to 29 GW in 2026, with no plans to retire any nuclear power plants in the latest plan. The share of renewable energy and nuclear power in the generation inches higher, while coal and LNG post marginal declines\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In gas-rich Turkmenistan, electricity generation rose by an estimated 2.7% y-o-y in the first eleven months of 2023. Turkmenistan exports electricity to Afghanistan, Iran,  Kyrgyzstan  and  Uzbekistan.  Turkmenistan  started  electricity  exports  to Kyrgyzstan in August 2021 and deliveries reached 1.6 TWh in 2023. In October 2022,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  agreed  to  ramp  up  electricity  supplies  to 4 TWh/yr, which could improve electricity supply security in Uzbekistan.\n\nIn Azerbaijan , electricity demand growth is estimated to have eased to 1% in 2023 from  more  than  4%  in  2022,  marking  a  further  slowdown  compared  to  the  7% rebound recorded in 2021. The country's electricity system is almost exclusively gas-fired  powered.  Fossil-fired  thermal  generation  remained  stable  in  2023,  as renewables continued to  increase.  Hydropower output  rose  by  15%,  while  wind\n\ngeneration fell by 30%. Solar power generation rose by 30%. Overall, the share of renewables in Azerbaijan's power remained broadly stable at around 6%.\n\nElectricity demand in Eurasia excluding Kazakhstan and Russia is expected to rise at an average growth rate of 3.5% per year in the 2024-2026 period. This will be largely  supported  by  the  region's  rising  population  and  economic  expansion, although  the  macroeconomic  outlook  has  worsened  since  Russia's  invasion  of Ukraine.\n\n## Middle East\n\n## Natural gas-fired generation continues to grow, but renewables gather pace\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China\n\nEgypt\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nKenya\n\nMorocco\n\nSenegal\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThailand\n\nUkraine\n\nThe European Commission also participates in the work of the IEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abstract\n\nElectricity is central to the functioning of modern societies and economies - and its  importance  is  only  growing  as  technologies  that  run  on  electricity,  such  as electric vehicles and heat pumps, become increasingly popular. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

An important new source of higher electricity consumption is coming from energy-intensive  data  centres,  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  cryptocurrencies, which could double by 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: The Philippines is targeting 35% renewables in its electricity mix by 2030. In 2023, the share sat at around 23%, and it is forecast to grow by close to 8% per year on average  from  2024-2026,  bringing  its  share  in  electricity  to  25%  in  the  same period.  This  increase  is  mostly  driven  by  solar  and  wind,  whose  share  in  the electricity mix more than doubles from 3% in 2023 to 7% in 2026. Measures in place to support growth in renewables include the Green Energy Option Program, which  enables  consumers  with  sufficient  load  and  metering  to  directly  procure renewables,  and  allowing  100%  foreign  ownership  of  renewable  assets,  since December 2022.\n\n## Singapore\n\n## Significant progress in the approval of the planned regional interconnection projects was achieved\n\nSingapore's electricity demand rose by less than 0.5% in 2023, down from 2% in 2022. For 2024-2026, we expect demand to increase by an average 2%, in line with economic growth. EVs will account for an increasing share of new electricity demand,  with  the  country  planning  to  phase  out  the  purchase  of  combustion vehicles by 2030.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: | Mt CO2          | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2026   | Growth  rate  2021- 2022   | Growth  rate  2022- 2023   | CAAGR 2023- 2026   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|\n| Total emissions | 13 263 | 13 448 | 13 575 | 13 111 | 1.4%                       | 0.9%                       | -1.2%              |\n\n## Breakdown of Asia Pacific electricity supply and emissions, 2021-2026\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

This highlights the massive potential and need for additional electricity supply in this region. Our forecast for Africa for the period 2024-2026 anticipates an average annual growth in total electricity demand of 4%, more than double  the  mean  growth  rate  observed  over  2015-2023.  Around  60%  of  this\n\ngrowth in demand is to be met by expanding renewables, the remaining mostly by natural gas. Renewable generation in Africa has grown on average by 5% in 20152023. We forecast an average of 10% growth in renewable generation out to 2026 in Africa, as deployment of renewables gathers pace. Nevertheless, In order to achieve the region's energy development and climate targets, energy investments will have to more than double from today's USD 90 billion by 2030, with almost two-thirds of this spending going towards clean energy.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: | Emissions: CO2 from electricity sector entering a structural decline ........  61                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| China accounts for half of the decline in global power generation emissions to 2026 ............ 61                                                                                                                                                |\n| China, the United States and European Union lead declines in power sector emissions ....... 62                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Emission intensity of the power sector to fall at an unprecedented rate.................................. 63                                                                                                                                       |\n| Prices: Wholesale electricity prices fall from record highs ........................  65                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Electricity prices in many regions still remain above pre-pandemic levels .............................. 65                                                                                                                                        |\n| What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world? ............................. 69                                                                                                                                         |\n| Household electricity prices and affordability  ........................................................................... 73                                                                                                                     |\n| Reliability: Monitoring electricity security remains essential .....................  76                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Specific measures and markets for system inertia are becoming common ............................ 76                                                                                                                                               |\n| Extreme weather events caused large-scale power outages in 2023 ..................................... 78                                                                                                                                           |\n| Supply and grid issues led to major outages mostly in emerging and developing countries .. 80                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Regional focus ................................................................................  88                                                                                                                                                |\n| Asia Pacific  ......................................................................................................  88                                                                                                                           |\n| Americas  ........................................................................................................  110                                                                                                                            |\n| Europe  ............................................................................................................  121 Eurasia ...........................................................................................................  138 |\n| Middle East ....................................................................................................  142                                                                                                                              |\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Feed-in  tariffs  are  offered  for  small  power  producers  in  specific  parts  of  the country, as well as PPAs for commercial scale projects, in order to reach a quota for renewable electricity projects. However, the Thai Energy Regulatory Commission has said that there is potential for faster growth of rooftop solar if the government enacts policies to encourage private sector uptake.\n\nThailand's Power Development Plan (PDP) is typically updated or revised every few years, with the most recent revision published in 2020 (PDP 2018 Revision 1). The upcoming update remains under discussion to ensure the balance between accelerated  deployment  of  distributed  variable  renewables  and  measures  to ensure that grid integration capabilities are adequately captured.\n\n## Malaysia\n\n## Gas-fired power generation is expected to overtake coal in 2026, while hydropower dominates growth in renewables\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand in Malaysia is estimated to have grown around 3% year-on-year. While the economic growth slowed down from the 2022 highs of a GDP growth of above 8%, economy is estimated to have grown robustly by almost 4%,  which  supported  electricity demand.  The  completion  of  several  new\n\nsemiconductor plants and data centre investments in 2024 are expected to boost electricity demand in the following years. We forecast average annual electricity demand growth of 3.4% through 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Kazakhstan's  electricity  demand  is  forecast  to  grow  by  around  2.2%  per  year between 2024-2026, largely to be met by expanding gas-fired power generation. There are also plans for Russia's Inter RAO to construct three coal-fired power plants in Kazakhstan, which would be relevant outside our forecast period.\n\n## Other Eurasia\n\nFollowing the strong rebound in 2021 of 4%, electricity demand growth slowed in other Eurasian markets to an average of 3% per year in 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn Uzbekistan , preliminary data indicates that the country's electricity output rose by  3%  in  the  first  eleven  months  of  2023  compared  to  the  same  period  a  year before. Uzbekistan continued to expand its power generation capacities in 2023. Gas-fired generation accounted for just over 80% of power generation. The Shirin thermal power plant (1.5 GW) started operations in October 2023 and is expected to ramp-up to full operations in Q1 2024. According to the Ministry of Energy, around 1.5 GW  of  wind  and  solar  capacity  was  targeted  to  be  installed  in  2023.  The continued decline in natural gas production in Uzbekistan (down by 9.5% y-o-y in the first eleven months of 2023) continues to weigh on electricity supply security.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ongoing European energy crisis, created the surge.

Power disruptions persisted for six hours on account of a systemic failure due to a lightning strike on a critical transmission line in the country.\n\nSeveral  other  countries  have  struggled  with  power  supply  challenges  in  2023 without  experiencing  full-scale  blackouts. Bangladesh faced  increased  power cuts due to rising demand exacerbated by unpredictable weather patterns and fuel shortages. India encountered power shortages driven by higher temperatures and decreased hydroelectric output. Peak power demand reached 223 GW in June amid soaring temperatures, with power outages observed in the northern states. In Madagascar , rolling power cuts were implemented due to low water reservoirs, reduced solar energy and fuel shortages during the winter months. Yemen had to shut down power stations due to fuel shortages in August. South Africa continued to have load shedding in 2023 due to supply challenges, with the total volume of load  shedding  up to  the  end  of  September  already  being  higher  than the  total volume of load shedding in the previous eight years together.\n\n## Understanding the human factor in power disruptions and outages\n\nThe recent IEA report Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions showed that grid-related  technical/equipment  failures  alone  cause  at  least  USD 100  billion economic damages per year globally. This underlines the need to better identify the cause of failures and the components involved in them.

Coal-fired generation is set to increase each year on average about 4% out to 2026. Renewables are expected to grow at a higher average 7% rate and gas-fired output at about 5%\n\nIn Japan , coal-fired generation is expected to decline annually on average by 3% and  in Korea by  3%  over  our  outlook  period  amid  increased  nuclear  and renewable generation. In other parts of Asia, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan , new coal plants are coming online, with coal-fired generation forecast to record average annual growth rates of 18% and 6%, respectively, from 2024 to 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation by source in Asia, 2021-2026\n\nNote: Other non-renewables includes oil, waste and other non-renewable energy sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spotlight: Nuclear generation will reach a new record high by 2025\n\nBetween 2024 and 2026, an additional 29 GW of new nuclear capacity is expected to come online globally, more than half of them in China and India. With new plants starting  commercial  operation  in  various  regions,  as  well  as  French  nuclear recovery and expected restarts in Japan, we forecast global nuclear generation will be almost 10% higher in 2026 compared to 2023. In 2025, global electricity generation from nuclear energy will have exceeded its previous record level in 2021.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinal electricity price\n\n- Compensation for indirect costs of EU ETS\n\nIEA.

Electricity price compensation included for countries that participate in EU ETS. For the calculation of the maximum possible state aid for electricity price compensation in European countries, the analysis assumes that the specific product has an electricity consumption benchmark of 0.8 and that the company in question receives the maximum possible state aid once this benchmark is incorporated into the maximum aid calculation. The final US electricity price is based off the final electricity for industry in Texas. The final electricity price for China is based off the final electricity for industry in Inner Mongolia.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on data from Electricity prices components for non-household consumers; Eurostat (2023), Communication from the Commission supplementing the Guidelines on certain State aid measures in the context of the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading post-2021; Official Journal of the European Union (2021), Southeastern U.S. Industrial Rate Survey; Brubaker &amp; Associates (2023), Will the Cancellation of Preferential Power Tariff in Inner Mongolia Impact New Energy Market?; Shanghai Metals Market.(2023).

In the first half of 2023, the losses rose to more than VND 35.4 trillion (USD 1.46 billion), according to a report by the Ministry of Planning and Investment.\n\n## Thailand\n\n## Energy security concerns sharpen the focus on boosting domestic natural gas production to support gas-fired power generation\n\nElectricity  demand  in  Thailand  rose  by  around  3%  in  2023.  Natural  gas-fired generation  increased  by  almost  13%,  whereas  coal-fired  output  decreased  by 14%. Renewable generation grew by 3%. As a result, CO2 intensity of the power sector declined from 470 g CO2/kWh in 2022 to 452 g CO2/kWh.\n\nSupported by economic growth, electricity demand in Thailand is forecast to rise at an average annual rate of 3% from 2024 out to 2026. Growth is expected to be met by increased supply from coal, gas and renewables. Currently, gas supplies around 65% of the electricity mix, coal 18% and renewables 17%. By 2026, the\n\nshare of coal is expected to rise by two percentage points while gas decreases by two percentage points, and renewables grow slightly. This corresponds to growth in both emissions and intensity through the forecast period.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Lastly, the Special Act on the Promotion of Distributed Energy was enacted in June  2023.  The  government  aims  to  reduce  the  existing  centralised  power generation  and  raise  the  share  of  distributed  power  generation  in  the  Korean energy market up to 30% by 2040, with a set of measures that, in particular, would promote the use of small renewable IPPs close to demand centres and enable them to sell electricity generation directly to consumers.\n\nTo manage the energy crisis, the government implemented a System Marginal Price (SMP) upper limit system in the electricity market starting from December 2022. Since the SMP needs to exceed the upper limit to be activated, the limit was triggered for only four months, spanning from December 2022 to February 2023 as well as April 2023. The price cap concluded in November 2023.\n\n## Australia\n\n## South Australia surpassed 75% wind and solar share in generation, marking a milestone\n\nElectricity demand in Australia fell by around 0.7% in 2023, with milder winter and summer temperatures compared to the previous year contributing to the decline. Demand is forecast to rise by just over 1% on average annually in 2024-2026, with growth coming primarily from the residential sector and higher EV deployment. Efficiency is expected to play an increasing role in limiting demand growth, with multiple initiatives implemented in 2023. Plans to improve efficiency include new investments for retrofitting commercial properties and government grants for small and medium-sized businesses. Consultations have also been initiated to improve the efficiency of electronic screens.\n"), AgentAction(tool='generate_image', tool_input={'text': 'A comparative analysis of electricity consumption in South Asian countries for the year 2024, highlighting trends in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.

India, as the largest economy in the region, is expected to see a robust increase in electricity demand, with a projected growth rate of approximately 6.5% annually. This growth is largely attributed to the expanding middle class, increased electrification, and a rising demand for air conditioning and other electrical appliances.\n\nBangladesh is also witnessing a surge in electricity consumption, with a focus on expanding its power generation capacity to meet the growing demand. The country has made significant investments in renewable energy sources, aiming to diversify its energy mix and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. In 2024, Bangladesh's electricity demand is expected to grow at a rate of around 5%, reflecting its ongoing economic development and urbanization.\n\nPakistan, on the other hand, faces challenges in meeting its electricity demand due to infrastructural issues and energy shortages. However, the government is implementing reforms to enhance the power sector's efficiency and reliability. In 2024, Pakistan's electricity consumption is projected to grow by approximately 4%, driven by industrial growth and urban expansion.\n\nSri Lanka and Nepal, while smaller in terms of total electricity consumption, are also experiencing growth. Sri Lanka's electricity demand is expected to rise by about 3%, as the country continues to recover from economic challenges and focuses on improving its energy infrastructure. Nepal, with its abundant hydropower resources, is projected to see a growth rate of around 4% in electricity consumption, driven by increased electrification in rural areas and investments in renewable energy projects.\n\nOverall, the electricity consumption landscape in South Asia for 2024 reflects a region in transition, with varying growth rates and challenges across different countries. The emphasis on renewable energy and infrastructure development is crucial for meeting the rising demand and ensuring sustainable energy access for all citizens.", 'conclusion': 'In conclusion, the electricity consumption trends in South Asian countries for 2024 indicate a region poised for significant growth, with India leading the charge.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually.

Power disruptions persisted for six hours on account of a systemic failure due to a lightning strike on a critical transmission line in the country.\n\nSeveral  other  countries  have  struggled  with  power  supply  challenges  in  2023 without  experiencing  full-scale  blackouts. Bangladesh faced  increased  power cuts due to rising demand exacerbated by unpredictable weather patterns and fuel shortages. India encountered power shortages driven by higher temperatures and decreased hydroelectric output. Peak power demand reached 223 GW in June amid soaring temperatures, with power outages observed in the northern states. In Madagascar , rolling power cuts were implemented due to low water reservoirs, reduced solar energy and fuel shortages during the winter months. Yemen had to shut down power stations due to fuel shortages in August. South Africa continued to have load shedding in 2023 due to supply challenges, with the total volume of load  shedding  up to  the  end  of  September  already  being  higher  than the  total volume of load shedding in the previous eight years together.\n\n## Understanding the human factor in power disruptions and outages\n\nThe recent IEA report Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions showed that grid-related  technical/equipment  failures  alone  cause  at  least  USD 100  billion economic damages per year globally. This underlines the need to better identify the cause of failures and the components involved in them.

This highlights the massive potential and need for additional electricity supply in this region. Our forecast for Africa for the period 2024-2026 anticipates an average annual growth in total electricity demand of 4%, more than double  the  mean  growth  rate  observed  over  2015-2023.  Around  60%  of  this\n\ngrowth in demand is to be met by expanding renewables, the remaining mostly by natural gas. Renewable generation in Africa has grown on average by 5% in 20152023. We forecast an average of 10% growth in renewable generation out to 2026 in Africa, as deployment of renewables gathers pace. Nevertheless, In order to achieve the region's energy development and climate targets, energy investments will have to more than double from today's USD 90 billion by 2030, with almost two-thirds of this spending going towards clean energy.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Wholesale prices in Japan and India remain elevated above 2019 levels\n\nWholesale electricity prices in Japan fell about 50% in 2023 compared to 2022, to an average of JPY 11 930/MWh (USD 85/MWh). In addition to lower prices for energy commodities, Japan's power market in 2023 was characterised by overall lower electricity demand and a stable supply situation, despite higher temperatures  that  drove  cooling  consumption  during  its  hottest  summer  in recorded history. Reportedly there is limited concern for a tight supply-demand outlook for the winter of 2023/24, which is reflected in the stable trend of futures prices.\n\nIndia remains the only market that did not post a substantial drop in wholesale electricity prices in 2023. Prices fell 4% in 2023 to INR 5 540/MWh (USD 68/MWh),  but  were  still  almost  double  those  in  2019.  The  tight  supply situation due to strong demand growth kept prices elevated. The price cap of INR 10 000/MWh  continued  to  be  implemented  to  protect  the  interests  of  buyers. Further, a high price segment was introduced to cover costly power generation technologies (gas and imported coal), but has seen low and intermittent buyer presence.\n\n## What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world?\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union , following a 3.1% decline in 2022, electricity demand fell by  a  further  3.2%  in  2023.  We  anticipate  a  return  to  growth  in  2024  of  1.8%, assuming a partial recovery in the industry sector given more moderate energy prices and expanding electrification of the transportation and heating sectors. EU electricity  demand is forecast to grow on average by 2.5% annually during the\n\n2025-2026 period, supported by an improved economic outlook. Nevertheless, following  the  record  demand  contraction  in  the  European  Union  last  year, uncertainties surround over how much of this decline is temporary and how much is structural.\n\n## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

For example, the state of Karnataka had power shortages of approximately 1 500-2 000 MW linked to insufficient rain. In addition to promoting wind and solar generation in the country, there is renewed focus on developing large hydro and nuclear power plants for base load and balancing of the grid. To support hydropower development, over 12 stalled hydro projects (11.5 GW total capacity)  that  were  awarded  to  private  sector  companies  15  years  ago  were transferred in August 2023 to central public sector entities under the Ministry of Power, to enable the projects to advance.\n\nIn  a  milestone  for  India,  its  largest  domestically  built  nuclear  power  plant,  the 700 MWe  Kakrapar  Unit  3  reactor,  commenced  operations  in  Gujarat  in  June 2023, and reached full capacity in August. Based on the country's project timeline, we expect nuclear power generation to increase rapidly during 2024-2026, with new plants totalling an estimated 4 GW of capacity entering commercial operation over the period. India currently has 23 operable nuclear reactors providing about 2% of the country's electricity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China\n\nEgypt\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nKenya\n\nMorocco\n\nSenegal\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThailand\n\nUkraine\n\nThe European Commission also participates in the work of the IEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abstract\n\nElectricity is central to the functioning of modern societies and economies - and its  importance  is  only  growing  as  technologies  that  run  on  electricity,  such  as electric vehicles and heat pumps, become increasingly popular. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\nIn  China,  the  post-pandemic  economic  recovery  paved  the  way  for  a  strong increase in  electricity  demand  of  6.4%  in  2023,  with  the  services  and  industry sectors  experiencing  the  most  robust  rebound.  With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

CC BY 4.0.\n\nNotes: The indirect electricity imports of selected energy-intensive goods include chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp and cement. Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods are estimated as the electricity required to manufacture the imported product in the European Union based on the electricity intensity of production values in the European Union. The 2023 values are estimated based on Q1-Q3 2023 data and analysis of latest market trends.\n\nSource: IEA analysis based on data from EU trade since 1999 by SITC and Eurostat (2023).\n\nThe largest  cumulative  increases  in  energy-intensive  imports  since  2021  have been in primary aluminium. In 2022 and 2023 combined, there was an additional 20 TWh of indirect electricity imports, compared to 2021 levels. Around half of this came from higher imports from India, which was followed by United Arab Emirates. Chemicals was another sector which saw growth in imports in 2022, with about 2 TWh more indirect electricity imported compared to 2021, mainly from the United States and  China.  But  the  imports  of  chemicals  declined  in  2023  amid  slower economic activity, more than offsetting this increase. Pulp and cement imports similarly saw increases in 2022, but were more than offset by significant declines in 2023.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Data centres are significant drivers of electricity demand growth in many regions\n\nThere are currently more than 8 000 data centres globally, with about 33% of these located in the United States, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China. US data centre electricity consumption is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years, increasing from around 200 TWh in 2022 (~4% of US electricity demand), to almost 260 TWh in 2026 to account for 6% of total electricity demand. Growth will be driven by increased adoption of 5G networks and cloud-based services, as well as competitive state tax incentives.\n\nChina's State Grid Energy Research Institute expects electricity demand in the country's data centre sector to double to 400 TWh by 2030, compared to 2020. We forecast electricity consumption from data centres in China to reach around 300 TWh  by  2026.  Regulations  are  being  updated  to  promote  sustainable practices in current and future data centres to align them with decarbonisation strategies. A major source of data centre growth is expected to come from the rapid expansion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in Europe, 2023 vs 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nWe expect electricity demand to grow by 2.4% per year on average over the 202426 forecast period in Europe, supported by a gradual recovery in the industrial activity,  further  electrification  of  the  heating  and  transport  sectors  and  the expansion in the data centre sector.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: We expect India's share of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation (wind and solar PV) to reach 15% by 2026. In order to ensure secure electricity supply and adequately utilise high shares of renewable energy, the government announced several policy measures to promote and develop energy storage technologies. The National Electricity Plan (NEP), released by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in May 2023, estimates an energy storage requirement of 16.1 GW (7.5 GW pumped storage hydropower and 8.7 GW of batteries) by 2026-2027. Related to this, the Ministry of Power announced the preparation of a national framework for the planning and establishment of energy storage systems. Following that, viability gap  funding  (VGF)  for  4 000 MWh  of  battery  energy  storage  system  (BESS) projects was formalised. In a current tariff-based competitive bidding process, the discovered cost for BESS is INR 10.18/kWh (USD 0.12/kWh). The VGF scheme targets a reduction in the levelised cost of BESS ranging from INR 5.5/kWh to INR 6.6/kWh (USD 0.066/kWh to USD 0.079/kWh) by 2030-2031. To enable local development  of  long  duration  storage  at  a  cheaper  rate  than  BESS,  the government released new guidelines for pumped storage hydropower projects in April  this  year,  with  interstate  transmission  charges  being  waived  for  pumped storage construction awarded by June 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Global trends\n\n## Demand: Global electricity use posts strong growth to 2026\n\n## Emerging economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nGlobal electricity demand grew by a relatively modest 2.2% in 2023, down from 2.4% in 2022. Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNote: Advanced economies grouping in this chart excludes Mexico and Türkiye.\n\nStrong growth in emerging economies combined with an anticipated recovery in industry and ongoing electrification of the residential and transportation sectors in many parts of the world will be the mainstays of increasing electricity over our outlook. An important new source of higher electricity consumption is coming from energy-intensive  data  centres,  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  cryptocurrencies, which could double by 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Source: IEA analysis based on data from Eurostat and Destatis.\n\n## How much electricity does the European Union import in the form of energy-intensive goods?\n\nThe issue of reduced production of energy-intensive goods in the European Union amid high energy prices has contributed to an increase in imports in these sectors, which was particularly observable in 2022. This raises the question of how much electricity is not consumed in the European Union but is shifted to other regions and imported from there indirectly in the form of energy-intensive goods.\n\nOur analysis shows that over 160 TWh of electricity - corresponding to 6% of EU electricity demand - was indirectly imported in 2022 into the European Union in the form of energy-intensive goods made up by chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement. After an estimated 8% year-on-year increase in 2022, 2023 is expected to record a decline of 4% in indirect imports of electricity in the form of the energy-intensive goods, which can be attributed to the slowdown in EU manufacturing, weaker demand and overhang of inventories. Nevertheless, 2023 imports are still estimated to be 4% higher than the 2021 levels. This means that, in the years 2022 and 2023 combined, an additional 18 TWh of electricity was  imported  compared  to  2021  levels  in  the  form  of  energy-intensive  goods considered in our analysis, mostly due to higher primary aluminium imports.\n\n200%\n\n150%\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n-50%\n\n-100%\n\n-150%\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n## Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods (chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement) to the European Union by country of origin, 2019-2023\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ongoing European energy crisis, created the surge.

The  gains  largely  reflect  high household consumption and public spending on infrastructure and social services. As a result, electricity demand posted strong growth of about 4% in 2023, and is forecast at a higher annual average rate of 6% from 2024-2026, underpinned by continued robust economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Feed-in  tariffs  are  offered  for  small  power  producers  in  specific  parts  of  the country, as well as PPAs for commercial scale projects, in order to reach a quota for renewable electricity projects. However, the Thai Energy Regulatory Commission has said that there is potential for faster growth of rooftop solar if the government enacts policies to encourage private sector uptake.\n\nThailand's Power Development Plan (PDP) is typically updated or revised every few years, with the most recent revision published in 2020 (PDP 2018 Revision 1). The upcoming update remains under discussion to ensure the balance between accelerated  deployment  of  distributed  variable  renewables  and  measures  to ensure that grid integration capabilities are adequately captured.\n\n## Malaysia\n\n## Gas-fired power generation is expected to overtake coal in 2026, while hydropower dominates growth in renewables\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand in Malaysia is estimated to have grown around 3% year-on-year. While the economic growth slowed down from the 2022 highs of a GDP growth of above 8%, economy is estimated to have grown robustly by almost 4%,  which  supported  electricity demand.

Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually. By 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023.\n\n## Estimated electricity demand from traditional data centres, dedicated AI data centres and cryptocurrencies, 2022 and 2026, base case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Power disruptions persisted for six hours on account of a systemic failure due to a lightning strike on a critical transmission line in the country.\n\nSeveral  other  countries  have  struggled  with  power  supply  challenges  in  2023 without  experiencing  full-scale  blackouts. Bangladesh faced  increased  power cuts due to rising demand exacerbated by unpredictable weather patterns and fuel shortages. India encountered power shortages driven by higher temperatures and decreased hydroelectric output. Peak power demand reached 223 GW in June amid soaring temperatures, with power outages observed in the northern states. In Madagascar , rolling power cuts were implemented due to low water reservoirs, reduced solar energy and fuel shortages during the winter months. Yemen had to shut down power stations due to fuel shortages in August. South Africa continued to have load shedding in 2023 due to supply challenges, with the total volume of load  shedding  up to  the  end  of  September  already  being  higher  than the  total volume of load shedding in the previous eight years together.\n\n## Understanding the human factor in power disruptions and outages\n\nThe recent IEA report Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions showed that grid-related  technical/equipment  failures  alone  cause  at  least  USD 100  billion economic damages per year globally. This underlines the need to better identify the cause of failures and the components involved in them.

This highlights the massive potential and need for additional electricity supply in this region. Our forecast for Africa for the period 2024-2026 anticipates an average annual growth in total electricity demand of 4%, more than double  the  mean  growth  rate  observed  over  2015-2023.  Around  60%  of  this\n\ngrowth in demand is to be met by expanding renewables, the remaining mostly by natural gas. Renewable generation in Africa has grown on average by 5% in 20152023. We forecast an average of 10% growth in renewable generation out to 2026 in Africa, as deployment of renewables gathers pace. Nevertheless, In order to achieve the region's energy development and climate targets, energy investments will have to more than double from today's USD 90 billion by 2030, with almost two-thirds of this spending going towards clean energy.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Wholesale prices in Japan and India remain elevated above 2019 levels\n\nWholesale electricity prices in Japan fell about 50% in 2023 compared to 2022, to an average of JPY 11 930/MWh (USD 85/MWh). In addition to lower prices for energy commodities, Japan's power market in 2023 was characterised by overall lower electricity demand and a stable supply situation, despite higher temperatures  that  drove  cooling  consumption  during  its  hottest  summer  in recorded history. Reportedly there is limited concern for a tight supply-demand outlook for the winter of 2023/24, which is reflected in the stable trend of futures prices.\n\nIndia remains the only market that did not post a substantial drop in wholesale electricity prices in 2023. Prices fell 4% in 2023 to INR 5 540/MWh (USD 68/MWh),  but  were  still  almost  double  those  in  2019.  The  tight  supply situation due to strong demand growth kept prices elevated. The price cap of INR 10 000/MWh  continued  to  be  implemented  to  protect  the  interests  of  buyers. Further, a high price segment was introduced to cover costly power generation technologies (gas and imported coal), but has seen low and intermittent buyer presence.\n\n## What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world?\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union , following a 3.1% decline in 2022, electricity demand fell by  a  further  3.2%  in  2023.  We  anticipate  a  return  to  growth  in  2024  of  1.8%, assuming a partial recovery in the industry sector given more moderate energy prices and expanding electrification of the transportation and heating sectors. EU electricity  demand is forecast to grow on average by 2.5% annually during the\n\n2025-2026 period, supported by an improved economic outlook. Nevertheless, following  the  record  demand  contraction  in  the  European  Union  last  year, uncertainties surround over how much of this decline is temporary and how much is structural.\n\n## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

For example, the state of Karnataka had power shortages of approximately 1 500-2 000 MW linked to insufficient rain. In addition to promoting wind and solar generation in the country, there is renewed focus on developing large hydro and nuclear power plants for base load and balancing of the grid. To support hydropower development, over 12 stalled hydro projects (11.5 GW total capacity)  that  were  awarded  to  private  sector  companies  15  years  ago  were transferred in August 2023 to central public sector entities under the Ministry of Power, to enable the projects to advance.\n\nIn  a  milestone  for  India,  its  largest  domestically  built  nuclear  power  plant,  the 700 MWe  Kakrapar  Unit  3  reactor,  commenced  operations  in  Gujarat  in  June 2023, and reached full capacity in August. Based on the country's project timeline, we expect nuclear power generation to increase rapidly during 2024-2026, with new plants totalling an estimated 4 GW of capacity entering commercial operation over the period. India currently has 23 operable nuclear reactors providing about 2% of the country's electricity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China\n\nEgypt\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nKenya\n\nMorocco\n\nSenegal\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThailand\n\nUkraine\n\nThe European Commission also participates in the work of the IEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abstract\n\nElectricity is central to the functioning of modern societies and economies - and its  importance  is  only  growing  as  technologies  that  run  on  electricity,  such  as electric vehicles and heat pumps, become increasingly popular. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\nIn  China,  the  post-pandemic  economic  recovery  paved  the  way  for  a  strong increase in  electricity  demand  of  6.4%  in  2023,  with  the  services  and  industry sectors  experiencing  the  most  robust  rebound.  With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

CC BY 4.0.\n\nNotes: The indirect electricity imports of selected energy-intensive goods include chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp and cement. Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods are estimated as the electricity required to manufacture the imported product in the European Union based on the electricity intensity of production values in the European Union. The 2023 values are estimated based on Q1-Q3 2023 data and analysis of latest market trends.\n\nSource: IEA analysis based on data from EU trade since 1999 by SITC and Eurostat (2023).\n\nThe largest  cumulative  increases  in  energy-intensive  imports  since  2021  have been in primary aluminium. In 2022 and 2023 combined, there was an additional 20 TWh of indirect electricity imports, compared to 2021 levels. Around half of this came from higher imports from India, which was followed by United Arab Emirates. Chemicals was another sector which saw growth in imports in 2022, with about 2 TWh more indirect electricity imported compared to 2021, mainly from the United States and  China.  But  the  imports  of  chemicals  declined  in  2023  amid  slower economic activity, more than offsetting this increase. Pulp and cement imports similarly saw increases in 2022, but were more than offset by significant declines in 2023.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Data centres are significant drivers of electricity demand growth in many regions\n\nThere are currently more than 8 000 data centres globally, with about 33% of these located in the United States, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China. US data centre electricity consumption is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years, increasing from around 200 TWh in 2022 (~4% of US electricity demand), to almost 260 TWh in 2026 to account for 6% of total electricity demand. Growth will be driven by increased adoption of 5G networks and cloud-based services, as well as competitive state tax incentives.\n\nChina's State Grid Energy Research Institute expects electricity demand in the country's data centre sector to double to 400 TWh by 2030, compared to 2020. We forecast electricity consumption from data centres in China to reach around 300 TWh  by  2026.  Regulations  are  being  updated  to  promote  sustainable practices in current and future data centres to align them with decarbonisation strategies. A major source of data centre growth is expected to come from the rapid expansion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in Europe, 2023 vs 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nWe expect electricity demand to grow by 2.4% per year on average over the 202426 forecast period in Europe, supported by a gradual recovery in the industrial activity,  further  electrification  of  the  heating  and  transport  sectors  and  the expansion in the data centre sector.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: We expect India's share of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation (wind and solar PV) to reach 15% by 2026. In order to ensure secure electricity supply and adequately utilise high shares of renewable energy, the government announced several policy measures to promote and develop energy storage technologies. The National Electricity Plan (NEP), released by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in May 2023, estimates an energy storage requirement of 16.1 GW (7.5 GW pumped storage hydropower and 8.7 GW of batteries) by 2026-2027. Related to this, the Ministry of Power announced the preparation of a national framework for the planning and establishment of energy storage systems. Following that, viability gap  funding  (VGF)  for  4 000 MWh  of  battery  energy  storage  system  (BESS) projects was formalised. In a current tariff-based competitive bidding process, the discovered cost for BESS is INR 10.18/kWh (USD 0.12/kWh). The VGF scheme targets a reduction in the levelised cost of BESS ranging from INR 5.5/kWh to INR 6.6/kWh (USD 0.066/kWh to USD 0.079/kWh) by 2030-2031. To enable local development  of  long  duration  storage  at  a  cheaper  rate  than  BESS,  the government released new guidelines for pumped storage hydropower projects in April  this  year,  with  interstate  transmission  charges  being  waived  for  pumped storage construction awarded by June 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Global trends\n\n## Demand: Global electricity use posts strong growth to 2026\n\n## Emerging economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nGlobal electricity demand grew by a relatively modest 2.2% in 2023, down from 2.4% in 2022. Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNote: Advanced economies grouping in this chart excludes Mexico and Türkiye.\n\nStrong growth in emerging economies combined with an anticipated recovery in industry and ongoing electrification of the residential and transportation sectors in many parts of the world will be the mainstays of increasing electricity over our outlook. An important new source of higher electricity consumption is coming from energy-intensive  data  centres,  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  cryptocurrencies, which could double by 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Source: IEA analysis based on data from Eurostat and Destatis.\n\n## How much electricity does the European Union import in the form of energy-intensive goods?\n\nThe issue of reduced production of energy-intensive goods in the European Union amid high energy prices has contributed to an increase in imports in these sectors, which was particularly observable in 2022. This raises the question of how much electricity is not consumed in the European Union but is shifted to other regions and imported from there indirectly in the form of energy-intensive goods.\n\nOur analysis shows that over 160 TWh of electricity - corresponding to 6% of EU electricity demand - was indirectly imported in 2022 into the European Union in the form of energy-intensive goods made up by chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement. After an estimated 8% year-on-year increase in 2022, 2023 is expected to record a decline of 4% in indirect imports of electricity in the form of the energy-intensive goods, which can be attributed to the slowdown in EU manufacturing, weaker demand and overhang of inventories. Nevertheless, 2023 imports are still estimated to be 4% higher than the 2021 levels. This means that, in the years 2022 and 2023 combined, an additional 18 TWh of electricity was  imported  compared  to  2021  levels  in  the  form  of  energy-intensive  goods considered in our analysis, mostly due to higher primary aluminium imports.\n\n200%\n\n150%\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n-50%\n\n-100%\n\n-150%\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n## Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods (chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement) to the European Union by country of origin, 2019-2023\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ongoing European energy crisis, created the surge.

The  gains  largely  reflect  high household consumption and public spending on infrastructure and social services. As a result, electricity demand posted strong growth of about 4% in 2023, and is forecast at a higher annual average rate of 6% from 2024-2026, underpinned by continued robust economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Feed-in  tariffs  are  offered  for  small  power  producers  in  specific  parts  of  the country, as well as PPAs for commercial scale projects, in order to reach a quota for renewable electricity projects. However, the Thai Energy Regulatory Commission has said that there is potential for faster growth of rooftop solar if the government enacts policies to encourage private sector uptake.\n\nThailand's Power Development Plan (PDP) is typically updated or revised every few years, with the most recent revision published in 2020 (PDP 2018 Revision 1). The upcoming update remains under discussion to ensure the balance between accelerated  deployment  of  distributed  variable  renewables  and  measures  to ensure that grid integration capabilities are adequately captured.\n\n## Malaysia\n\n## Gas-fired power generation is expected to overtake coal in 2026, while hydropower dominates growth in renewables\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand in Malaysia is estimated to have grown around 3% year-on-year. While the economic growth slowed down from the 2022 highs of a GDP growth of above 8%, economy is estimated to have grown robustly by almost 4%,  which  supported  electricity demand.  The  completion  of  several  new\n\nsemiconductor plants and data centre investments in 2024 are expected to boost electricity demand in the following years.

With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China  provides  the  largest  share  of  global  electricity  demand  growth  in terms of volume, but India posts the fastest growth rate through 2026 among major economies. Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity  demand in India rose  by  7%  in  2023  compared to last year's 8.6%. Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

US data centre electricity consumption is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years, increasing from around 200 TWh in 2022 (~4% of US electricity demand), to almost 260 TWh in 2026 to account for 6% of total electricity demand. Growth will be driven by increased adoption of 5G networks and cloud-based services, as well as competitive state tax incentives.\n\nChina's State Grid Energy Research Institute expects electricity demand in the country's data centre sector to double to 400 TWh by 2030, compared to 2020. We forecast electricity consumption from data centres in China to reach around 300 TWh  by  2026.  Regulations  are  being  updated  to  promote  sustainable practices in current and future data centres to align them with decarbonisation strategies. A major source of data centre growth is expected to come from the rapid expansion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: | Emissions: CO2 from electricity sector entering a structural decline ........  61                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| China accounts for half of the decline in global power generation emissions to 2026 ............ 61                                                                                                                                                |\n| China, the United States and European Union lead declines in power sector emissions ....... 62                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Emission intensity of the power sector to fall at an unprecedented rate.................................. 63                                                                                                                                       |\n| Prices: Wholesale electricity prices fall from record highs ........................  65                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Electricity prices in many regions still remain above pre-pandemic levels .............................. 65                                                                                                                                        |\n| What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world? ............................. 69                                                                                                                                         |\n| Household electricity prices and affordability  ........................................................................... 73                                                                                                                     |\n| Reliability: Monitoring electricity security remains essential .....................  76                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Specific measures and markets for system inertia are becoming common ............................ 76                                                                                                                                               |\n| Extreme weather events caused large-scale power outages in 2023 ..................................... 78                                                                                                                                           |\n| Supply and grid issues led to major outages mostly in emerging and developing countries .. 80                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Regional focus ................................................................................  88                                                                                                                                                |\n| Asia Pacific  ......................................................................................................  88                                                                                                                           |\n| Americas  ........................................................................................................  110                                                                                                                            |\n| Europe  ............................................................................................................  121 Eurasia ...........................................................................................................  138 |\n| Middle East ....................................................................................................  142                                                                                                                              |\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## CO2 emissions from electricity generation in selected regions, 2014-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China, the United States and European Union lead declines in power sector emissions\n\nGlobal emissions from electricity generation are forecast to fall by more than 2% in 2024, followed by smaller declines of about 0.5% in both 2025 and 2026. The large contraction in emissions in 2024 assumes average weather conditions and that hydropower in China recovers from the drought-induced lows of the last three years, displacing coal and resulting in a 2.4% decline in China's emissions from electricity  generation. Followed by rapid renewables deployment and moderate demand growth, emissions in China are expected to decline by 1% per year on average in  2025-2026,  falling  back  to  2022  levels.  China  is  set  to  account  for almost half of the total decline in global emissions from power generation from 2024 to 2026.\n\nUS power sector emissions are expected to decline on average by 4% over the 2024-2026 period, led by the ongoing switch from coal to gas, and rapid growth of renewables. The country will account for one-quarter of the reductions in global power sector emissions, followed by the European Union at one-fifth of the total. EU annual reductions are forecast at an average 11% in 2024-2026.\n\nOver the outlook period, growth in electricity sector emissions is expected to come primarily  from  India,  Southeast  Asia,  and  other  emerging  economies.  The continued growth in coal-fired generation in India and Southeast Asia, combined with rising gas-fired output in the Middle East, will put upward pressure on global emissions. Nevertheless, these increases in emissions are not enough to offset large decreases expected in China, the United States and the European Union.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Continued electrification  of  China's  industrial  sector  and  strong  growth  in  road transport  (EV  charging)  accounts  for  an  increasing  share  of  China's  electricity demand over the forecast period. The rapid adoption of EVs, which now account for over 8% of the vehicles in the country, is markedly eroding growth in gasoline consumption in favour of electricity. A downward trend in the cement and glass industries  can  be  observed  since  2021,  which  is  relevant  for  the  construction sector.  By  contrast,  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  EVs  and  processing  of associated materials were significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in the industry sector in recent years and will remain on a solid upward trend.\n\n## Indexed production output in selected industries in China, 2015-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emissions: CO2 from electricity sector entering a structural decline\n\n## China accounts for half of the decline in global power generation emissions to 2026\n\nAfter  a  strong  rebound of  almost 8% in 2021, global emissions from electricity generation  rose  1.4%  in  2022.  Similarly,  emissions  increased  by  1%  in  2023, which is an upward revision from our previous July forecast. Fossil-fired power generation decreased in many regions in 2023, particularly in the United States and the European Union. At the same time, on a global scale, fossil-fired output remained  resilient  amid  reduced  hydropower  because  of  reasons  such  as droughts, below-normal rainfall, and low water availability due to early snowmelt. China,  India,  Viet  nam,  United  States,  Canada,  Türkiye  and  Mexico,  among others, were impacted by reduced hydropower generation. A strong increase in coal-fired output in China and India, driven by reduced hydropower and strong electricity demand growth, prevented a decline in global emissions in the electricity sector.  Nevertheless,  coal  in  China  is  expected  to  enter  a  slow  but  structural decline due  to a significant increase in renewables  deployment  and  the rebalancing of the economy. We expect global electricity sector emissions to fall 2.4% in 2024, followed by 0.5% declines of 0.5% in 2025-2026. While extreme weather,  economic  shocks  and  government  policies  could  cause  upticks  in individual years, the overall trend is expected to remain stable.\n\n## CO2 emissions from electricity generation in selected regions, 2014-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Electricity price compensation included for countries that participate in EU ETS.

Demand is forecast to rise by an average annual 4.6% from 2024 to 2026, with China expected to provide close to 70% of growth in the region by 2026. Asia Pacific, which accounts for just over 50% of global electricity consumption, will see renewables share of power generation rise from 27% to 35% in 2026 but coal-fired power remains the major source of supply. In 2023, coal accounted for 57% of the region's electricity generation, with lowcarbon sources such as nuclear, hydro, solar and wind contributing for 32% of the mix.  Due  to  its  strong  reliance  on  coal  for  power,  Asia  Pacific  has  the  highest electricity generation CO2 intensity of our analysed regions, at 590 g CO2/kWh in 2023, compared to a global average of 455 g CO2/kWh. The region's emissions from electricity generation are expected to record slight increases of 0.2% in 20252026, after a decline in 2024 due to an assumed recovery in hydropower.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The figures for 2024-2026 are forecast values.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nElectricity  demand  in  the United States ,  the  world's  second  largest  consumer behind  China,  declined  by  1.6%  in  2023,  after  2.6%  growth  in  2022.  A  major contributor to the downturn was the milder weather in 2023 compared to 2022. A slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor, albeit with significantly less impact than the weather. While record high summer temperatures in Texas drove up cooling demand, overall summer weather was milder in 2023 compared to last year. Similarly, winter months were also warmer, with the lowest number of heating degree days recorded since 2012. We forecast a moderate rebound in demand of 2.5% in 2024, assuming normal weather conditions, followed by an average growth rate of 1% in 2025-2026 due to continued electrification and strong growth in the data centre sector. We expect more than one-third of the additional US electricity demand out to 2026 to come from the expanding data centres.\n\nElectricity demand in Japan declined by 3.7% in 2023 compared to a 1% increase in 2022. Despite high temperatures boosting cooling demand in the summer, the slowdown in the manufacturing sector  and  continued  energy  saving  measures exerted strong downwards pressure on electricity consumption. However, against a backdrop of an assumed gradual recovery in the manufacturing sector in 2024 and  accelerating  electrification  of  the  transport  and  heating  sectors  over  the outlook period, a modest rebound in electricity demand of 1.2% in 2024 is forecast, followed by an average annual growth rate of 0.2% in 2025-2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: The rapid growth of renewables, supported by rising nuclear generation, is set to displace global coal-fired generation, which is forecast to fall by an average of 1.7% annually through 2026. This follows a 1.6% increase in coalfired output in 2023 amid droughts in India and China that reduced hydropower output and increased coal-fired generation, more than offsetting strong declines in coal-fired  generation  in  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union.  The  major factor  that  will  determine  the  global  outlook  is evolving  trends  in  China,  where more than half of world's coal-fired generation takes place. Coal-fired generation in China is currently on course to experience a slow structural decline, driven by the strong expansion of renewables and growing nuclear generation, as well as moderating economic growth. Despite the commissioning of new plants to boost the security of energy supply, the utilisation rate of Chinese coal-fired plants is expected  to  continue  to  fall  as  they  are  used  more  flexibly  to  complement renewables.  Nevertheless,  coal-fired  generation  in  China  will  be  influenced significantly by the pace of the economy's rebalancing, hydropower trends, and bottlenecks in integrating renewables into the country's power system.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Estimated final electricity price for large industrial customers in energy-intensive industries, 2019-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Evolution of the shares of low-emissions sources vs. fossil fuels in global electricity generation (left), and the annual change of fossil fuel share (right), 1975-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Coal constrained by renewables in China, but not in other parts of Asia\n\nAs highlighted in IEA's Renewable s 2023 report, China commissioned in 2023 as much solar  PV  capacity  as  the  entire  world  did  in  2022,  while  its  wind  power capacity additions also grew by 66% year-on-year. The strong expansion trend of renewables is expected to result in renewable generation growing by around 20% in 2024, assuming a recovery in hydropower, and 13% on average in 2025-2026, covering  all  the  additional  Chinese  demand  growth  and  suppressing  coal-fired output.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  weather  impact,  such  as  the  reduced hydropower due to droughts as observed in recent years, can cause an uptick in Chinese coal-fired generation in individual years. However, the overall trend of coal-fired  supply  being  restrained  and  replaced by  strong  growth  in  renewable energy sources (RES) is expected to remain largely stable.\n\nGiven India 's rapid increase in demand for electricity, coal-fired power generation is expected to rise by an average 2.5% annually in 2024-2026. At the same time, renewable generation will accelerate, with an average annual growth rate of 13% over the period.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the United States, the Energy Act of 2020 requires the federal government to conduct studies on the energy and water use of data centres, to create applicable energy efficiency metrics and good practices that promote efficiency, along with public reporting of historical data centre energy and water usage. The Department of  Energy  (DOE)  is  supporting  the  local  production  of  semiconductors  and  is funding  the  development  of  more  efficient  semiconductors  over  the  next  two decades.  More  efficient  semiconductors  reduce  cooling  requirements,  thus supporting the decarbonisation of the sector. At a state level, regulators in Virginia and Oregon have already imposed requirements for better sustainability practices and carbon emissions reductions.\n\nChinese regulators will require all data centres acquired by public organisations to improve their energy efficiency and be entirely powered by renewable energy by 2032, starting with a 5% share mandate for renewables in 2023.\n\n## New fields of research can help increase efficiency and reduce energy consumption in data centres\n\nThe primary drivers of data centre electricity demand are the cooling systems and the  servers  themselves,  with  each  typically  accounting  for  40%  of  the  total consumption.  The  remaining  20%  is  consumed  by  the  power  supply  system, storage devices and communication equipment.

Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

We expect 40 to 50 GW of new coal-fired power plant capacity to be added annually from 2024 through 2026. As the share of renewables rises, the role  of  coal-fired  plants  is  changing  from  providing  base-load  supply  to  more flexible operation. The average capacity factor of coal-fired power plants in China has come down from 61% in 2010 to 53% in 2023, and this trend is set to continue. Government authorities announced a new capacity remuneration mechanism for coal power plants, starting in January 2024, which aims to help them recover part of  their  fixed  costs  as  low-carbon generation meets an increasing share of the load.\n\nEnergy security remains a significant issue. Following power outages in 2021 and 2022, concerns emerged at the beginning of the summer of 2023 that the country would struggle to keep the lights on amid record heat waves. Summer peak load reached historic highs of 1 340 GW, up 50 GW compared to the previous year. Droughts and higher than normal temperatures from winter 2022 to spring 2023 resulted in exceptionally low water reservoir levels. The government implemented policies to boost domestic coal production and imports.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Feed-in  tariffs  are  offered  for  small  power  producers  in  specific  parts  of  the country, as well as PPAs for commercial scale projects, in order to reach a quota for renewable electricity projects.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period.

Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026.

The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.

Power disruptions persisted for six hours on account of a systemic failure due to a lightning strike on a critical transmission line in the country.\n\nSeveral  other  countries  have  struggled  with  power  supply  challenges  in  2023 without  experiencing  full-scale  blackouts. Bangladesh faced  increased  power cuts due to rising demand exacerbated by unpredictable weather patterns and fuel shortages. India encountered power shortages driven by higher temperatures and decreased hydroelectric output. Peak power demand reached 223 GW in June amid soaring temperatures, with power outages observed in the northern states. In Madagascar , rolling power cuts were implemented due to low water reservoirs, reduced solar energy and fuel shortages during the winter months. Yemen had to shut down power stations due to fuel shortages in August. South Africa continued to have load shedding in 2023 due to supply challenges, with the total volume of load  shedding  up to  the  end  of  September  already  being  higher  than the  total volume of load shedding in the previous eight years together.\n\n## Understanding the human factor in power disruptions and outages\n\nThe recent IEA report Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions showed that grid-related  technical/equipment  failures  alone  cause  at  least  USD 100  billion economic damages per year globally. This underlines the need to better identify the cause of failures and the components involved in them.

CC BY 4.0.\n\nAfrica's  population  is  set  to  grow  rapidly,  making  up  one-fifth  of  the  world's population by 2030. This highlights the massive potential and need for additional electricity supply in this region. Our forecast for Africa for the period 2024-2026 anticipates an average annual growth in total electricity demand of 4%, more than double  the  mean  growth  rate  observed  over  2015-2023.  Around  60%  of  this\n\ngrowth in demand is to be met by expanding renewables, the remaining mostly by natural gas. Renewable generation in Africa has grown on average by 5% in 20152023. We forecast an average of 10% growth in renewable generation out to 2026 in Africa, as deployment of renewables gathers pace. Nevertheless, In order to achieve the region's energy development and climate targets, energy investments will have to more than double from today's USD 90 billion by 2030, with almost two-thirds of this spending going towards clean energy.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Wholesale prices in Japan and India remain elevated above 2019 levels\n\nWholesale electricity prices in Japan fell about 50% in 2023 compared to 2022, to an average of JPY 11 930/MWh (USD 85/MWh). In addition to lower prices for energy commodities, Japan's power market in 2023 was characterised by overall lower electricity demand and a stable supply situation, despite higher temperatures  that  drove  cooling  consumption  during  its  hottest  summer  in recorded history. Reportedly there is limited concern for a tight supply-demand outlook for the winter of 2023/24, which is reflected in the stable trend of futures prices.\n\nIndia remains the only market that did not post a substantial drop in wholesale electricity prices in 2023. Prices fell 4% in 2023 to INR 5 540/MWh (USD 68/MWh),  but  were  still  almost  double  those  in  2019.  The  tight  supply situation due to strong demand growth kept prices elevated. The price cap of INR 10 000/MWh  continued  to  be  implemented  to  protect  the  interests  of  buyers. Further, a high price segment was introduced to cover costly power generation technologies (gas and imported coal), but has seen low and intermittent buyer presence.\n\n## What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world?\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union , following a 3.1% decline in 2022, electricity demand fell by  a  further  3.2%  in  2023.  We  anticipate  a  return  to  growth  in  2024  of  1.8%, assuming a partial recovery in the industry sector given more moderate energy prices and expanding electrification of the transportation and heating sectors. EU electricity  demand is forecast to grow on average by 2.5% annually during the\n\n2025-2026 period, supported by an improved economic outlook. Nevertheless, following  the  record  demand  contraction  in  the  European  Union  last  year, uncertainties surround over how much of this decline is temporary and how much is structural.\n\n## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The figures for 2024-2026 are forecast values.\n\n## Hydropower, nuclear, storage and increased power system efficiency are high on the Indian government's agenda\n\nIndia saw a massive 15% fall in hydropower generation in 2023 compared to a year  earlier,  which  resulted  in  shortages  and  outages  in  several  parts  of  the country. For example, the state of Karnataka had power shortages of approximately 1 500-2 000 MW linked to insufficient rain. In addition to promoting wind and solar generation in the country, there is renewed focus on developing large hydro and nuclear power plants for base load and balancing of the grid. To support hydropower development, over 12 stalled hydro projects (11.5 GW total capacity)  that  were  awarded  to  private  sector  companies  15  years  ago  were transferred in August 2023 to central public sector entities under the Ministry of Power, to enable the projects to advance.\n\nIn  a  milestone  for  India,  its  largest  domestically  built  nuclear  power  plant,  the 700 MWe  Kakrapar  Unit  3  reactor,  commenced  operations  in  Gujarat  in  June 2023, and reached full capacity in August. Based on the country's project timeline, we expect nuclear power generation to increase rapidly during 2024-2026, with new plants totalling an estimated 4 GW of capacity entering commercial operation over the period. India currently has 23 operable nuclear reactors providing about 2% of the country's electricity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China\n\nEgypt\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nKenya\n\nMorocco\n\nSenegal\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThailand\n\nUkraine\n\nThe European Commission also participates in the work of the IEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abstract\n\nElectricity is central to the functioning of modern societies and economies - and its  importance  is  only  growing  as  technologies  that  run  on  electricity,  such  as electric vehicles and heat pumps, become increasingly popular. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\nIn  China,  the  post-pandemic  economic  recovery  paved  the  way  for  a  strong increase in  electricity  demand  of  6.4%  in  2023,  with  the  services  and  industry sectors  experiencing  the  most  robust  rebound.  With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

CC BY 4.0.\n\nNotes: The indirect electricity imports of selected energy-intensive goods include chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp and cement. Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods are estimated as the electricity required to manufacture the imported product in the European Union based on the electricity intensity of production values in the European Union. The 2023 values are estimated based on Q1-Q3 2023 data and analysis of latest market trends.\n\nSource: IEA analysis based on data from EU trade since 1999 by SITC and Eurostat (2023).\n\nThe largest  cumulative  increases  in  energy-intensive  imports  since  2021  have been in primary aluminium. In 2022 and 2023 combined, there was an additional 20 TWh of indirect electricity imports, compared to 2021 levels. Around half of this came from higher imports from India, which was followed by United Arab Emirates. Chemicals was another sector which saw growth in imports in 2022, with about 2 TWh more indirect electricity imported compared to 2021, mainly from the United States and  China.  But  the  imports  of  chemicals  declined  in  2023  amid  slower economic activity, more than offsetting this increase. Pulp and cement imports similarly saw increases in 2022, but were more than offset by significant declines in 2023.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Data centres are significant drivers of electricity demand growth in many regions\n\nThere are currently more than 8 000 data centres globally, with about 33% of these located in the United States, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China. US data centre electricity consumption is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years, increasing from around 200 TWh in 2022 (~4% of US electricity demand), to almost 260 TWh in 2026 to account for 6% of total electricity demand. Growth will be driven by increased adoption of 5G networks and cloud-based services, as well as competitive state tax incentives.\n\nChina's State Grid Energy Research Institute expects electricity demand in the country's data centre sector to double to 400 TWh by 2030, compared to 2020. We forecast electricity consumption from data centres in China to reach around 300 TWh  by  2026.  Regulations  are  being  updated  to  promote  sustainable practices in current and future data centres to align them with decarbonisation strategies. A major source of data centre growth is expected to come from the rapid expansion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in Europe, 2023 vs 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nWe expect electricity demand to grow by 2.4% per year on average over the 202426 forecast period in Europe, supported by a gradual recovery in the industrial activity,  further  electrification  of  the  heating  and  transport  sectors  and  the expansion in the data centre sector.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: We expect India's share of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation (wind and solar PV) to reach 15% by 2026. In order to ensure secure electricity supply and adequately utilise high shares of renewable energy, the government announced several policy measures to promote and develop energy storage technologies. The National Electricity Plan (NEP), released by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in May 2023, estimates an energy storage requirement of 16.1 GW (7.5 GW pumped storage hydropower and 8.7 GW of batteries) by 2026-2027. Related to this, the Ministry of Power announced the preparation of a national framework for the planning and establishment of energy storage systems. Following that, viability gap  funding  (VGF)  for  4 000 MWh  of  battery  energy  storage  system  (BESS) projects was formalised. In a current tariff-based competitive bidding process, the discovered cost for BESS is INR 10.18/kWh (USD 0.12/kWh). The VGF scheme targets a reduction in the levelised cost of BESS ranging from INR 5.5/kWh to INR 6.6/kWh (USD 0.066/kWh to USD 0.079/kWh) by 2030-2031. To enable local development  of  long  duration  storage  at  a  cheaper  rate  than  BESS,  the government released new guidelines for pumped storage hydropower projects in April  this  year,  with  interstate  transmission  charges  being  waived  for  pumped storage construction awarded by June 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Global trends\n\n## Demand: Global electricity use posts strong growth to 2026\n\n## Emerging economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nGlobal electricity demand grew by a relatively modest 2.2% in 2023, down from 2.4% in 2022. Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNote: Advanced economies grouping in this chart excludes Mexico and Türkiye.\n\nStrong growth in emerging economies combined with an anticipated recovery in industry and ongoing electrification of the residential and transportation sectors in many parts of the world will be the mainstays of increasing electricity over our outlook. An important new source of higher electricity consumption is coming from energy-intensive  data  centres,  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  cryptocurrencies, which could double by 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Source: IEA analysis based on data from Eurostat and Destatis.\n\n## How much electricity does the European Union import in the form of energy-intensive goods?\n\nThe issue of reduced production of energy-intensive goods in the European Union amid high energy prices has contributed to an increase in imports in these sectors, which was particularly observable in 2022. This raises the question of how much electricity is not consumed in the European Union but is shifted to other regions and imported from there indirectly in the form of energy-intensive goods.\n\nOur analysis shows that over 160 TWh of electricity - corresponding to 6% of EU electricity demand - was indirectly imported in 2022 into the European Union in the form of energy-intensive goods made up by chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement. After an estimated 8% year-on-year increase in 2022, 2023 is expected to record a decline of 4% in indirect imports of electricity in the form of the energy-intensive goods, which can be attributed to the slowdown in EU manufacturing, weaker demand and overhang of inventories. Nevertheless, 2023 imports are still estimated to be 4% higher than the 2021 levels. This means that, in the years 2022 and 2023 combined, an additional 18 TWh of electricity was  imported  compared  to  2021  levels  in  the  form  of  energy-intensive  goods considered in our analysis, mostly due to higher primary aluminium imports.\n\n200%\n\n150%\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n-50%\n\n-100%\n\n-150%\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n## Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods (chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement) to the European Union by country of origin, 2019-2023\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ongoing European energy crisis, created the surge.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually. By 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023.\n\n## Estimated electricity demand from traditional data centres, dedicated AI data centres and cryptocurrencies, 2022 and 2026, base case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Power disruptions persisted for six hours on account of a systemic failure due to a lightning strike on a critical transmission line in the country.\n\nSeveral  other  countries  have  struggled  with  power  supply  challenges  in  2023 without  experiencing  full-scale  blackouts. Bangladesh faced  increased  power cuts due to rising demand exacerbated by unpredictable weather patterns and fuel shortages. India encountered power shortages driven by higher temperatures and decreased hydroelectric output. Peak power demand reached 223 GW in June amid soaring temperatures, with power outages observed in the northern states. In Madagascar , rolling power cuts were implemented due to low water reservoirs, reduced solar energy and fuel shortages during the winter months. Yemen had to shut down power stations due to fuel shortages in August. South Africa continued to have load shedding in 2023 due to supply challenges, with the total volume of load  shedding  up to  the  end  of  September  already  being  higher  than the  total volume of load shedding in the previous eight years together.\n\n## Understanding the human factor in power disruptions and outages\n\nThe recent IEA report Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions showed that grid-related  technical/equipment  failures  alone  cause  at  least  USD 100  billion economic damages per year globally. This underlines the need to better identify the cause of failures and the components involved in them.

This highlights the massive potential and need for additional electricity supply in this region. Our forecast for Africa for the period 2024-2026 anticipates an average annual growth in total electricity demand of 4%, more than double  the  mean  growth  rate  observed  over  2015-2023.  Around  60%  of  this\n\ngrowth in demand is to be met by expanding renewables, the remaining mostly by natural gas. Renewable generation in Africa has grown on average by 5% in 20152023. We forecast an average of 10% growth in renewable generation out to 2026 in Africa, as deployment of renewables gathers pace. Nevertheless, In order to achieve the region's energy development and climate targets, energy investments will have to more than double from today's USD 90 billion by 2030, with almost two-thirds of this spending going towards clean energy.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Wholesale prices in Japan and India remain elevated above 2019 levels\n\nWholesale electricity prices in Japan fell about 50% in 2023 compared to 2022, to an average of JPY 11 930/MWh (USD 85/MWh). In addition to lower prices for energy commodities, Japan's power market in 2023 was characterised by overall lower electricity demand and a stable supply situation, despite higher temperatures  that  drove  cooling  consumption  during  its  hottest  summer  in recorded history. Reportedly there is limited concern for a tight supply-demand outlook for the winter of 2023/24, which is reflected in the stable trend of futures prices.\n\nIndia remains the only market that did not post a substantial drop in wholesale electricity prices in 2023. Prices fell 4% in 2023 to INR 5 540/MWh (USD 68/MWh),  but  were  still  almost  double  those  in  2019.  The  tight  supply situation due to strong demand growth kept prices elevated. The price cap of INR 10 000/MWh  continued  to  be  implemented  to  protect  the  interests  of  buyers. Further, a high price segment was introduced to cover costly power generation technologies (gas and imported coal), but has seen low and intermittent buyer presence.\n\n## What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world?\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union , following a 3.1% decline in 2022, electricity demand fell by  a  further  3.2%  in  2023.  We  anticipate  a  return  to  growth  in  2024  of  1.8%, assuming a partial recovery in the industry sector given more moderate energy prices and expanding electrification of the transportation and heating sectors. EU electricity  demand is forecast to grow on average by 2.5% annually during the\n\n2025-2026 period, supported by an improved economic outlook. Nevertheless, following  the  record  demand  contraction  in  the  European  Union  last  year, uncertainties surround over how much of this decline is temporary and how much is structural.\n\n## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The figures for 2024-2026 are forecast values.\n\n## Hydropower, nuclear, storage and increased power system efficiency are high on the Indian government's agenda\n\nIndia saw a massive 15% fall in hydropower generation in 2023 compared to a year  earlier,  which  resulted  in  shortages  and  outages  in  several  parts  of  the country. For example, the state of Karnataka had power shortages of approximately 1 500-2 000 MW linked to insufficient rain. In addition to promoting wind and solar generation in the country, there is renewed focus on developing large hydro and nuclear power plants for base load and balancing of the grid. To support hydropower development, over 12 stalled hydro projects (11.5 GW total capacity)  that  were  awarded  to  private  sector  companies  15  years  ago  were transferred in August 2023 to central public sector entities under the Ministry of Power, to enable the projects to advance.\n\nIn  a  milestone  for  India,  its  largest  domestically  built  nuclear  power  plant,  the 700 MWe  Kakrapar  Unit  3  reactor,  commenced  operations  in  Gujarat  in  June 2023, and reached full capacity in August. Based on the country's project timeline, we expect nuclear power generation to increase rapidly during 2024-2026, with new plants totalling an estimated 4 GW of capacity entering commercial operation over the period. India currently has 23 operable nuclear reactors providing about 2% of the country's electricity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China\n\nEgypt\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nKenya\n\nMorocco\n\nSenegal\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThailand\n\nUkraine\n\nThe European Commission also participates in the work of the IEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abstract\n\nElectricity is central to the functioning of modern societies and economies - and its  importance  is  only  growing  as  technologies  that  run  on  electricity,  such  as electric vehicles and heat pumps, become increasingly popular. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA). It was designed and directed by Eren Çam, Energy Analyst for Electricity.\n\nThe main authors are: Eren Çam, Zoe Hungerford, Niklas Schoch, Francys Pinto Miranda, Carlos David Yáñez de León.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union, data centre electricity consumption is estimated at slightly below 100 TWh in 2022, almost 4% of total EU electricity demand. Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\nIn  China,  the  post-pandemic  economic  recovery  paved  the  way  for  a  strong increase in  electricity  demand  of  6.4%  in  2023,  with  the  services  and  industry sectors  experiencing  the  most  robust  rebound.  With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

CC BY 4.0.\n\nNotes: The indirect electricity imports of selected energy-intensive goods include chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp and cement. Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods are estimated as the electricity required to manufacture the imported product in the European Union based on the electricity intensity of production values in the European Union. The 2023 values are estimated based on Q1-Q3 2023 data and analysis of latest market trends.\n\nSource: IEA analysis based on data from EU trade since 1999 by SITC and Eurostat (2023).\n\nThe largest  cumulative  increases  in  energy-intensive  imports  since  2021  have been in primary aluminium. In 2022 and 2023 combined, there was an additional 20 TWh of indirect electricity imports, compared to 2021 levels. Around half of this came from higher imports from India, which was followed by United Arab Emirates. Chemicals was another sector which saw growth in imports in 2022, with about 2 TWh more indirect electricity imported compared to 2021, mainly from the United States and  China.  But  the  imports  of  chemicals  declined  in  2023  amid  slower economic activity, more than offsetting this increase. Pulp and cement imports similarly saw increases in 2022, but were more than offset by significant declines in 2023.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Data centres are significant drivers of electricity demand growth in many regions\n\nThere are currently more than 8 000 data centres globally, with about 33% of these located in the United States, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China. US data centre electricity consumption is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years, increasing from around 200 TWh in 2022 (~4% of US electricity demand), to almost 260 TWh in 2026 to account for 6% of total electricity demand. Growth will be driven by increased adoption of 5G networks and cloud-based services, as well as competitive state tax incentives.\n\nChina's State Grid Energy Research Institute expects electricity demand in the country's data centre sector to double to 400 TWh by 2030, compared to 2020. We forecast electricity consumption from data centres in China to reach around 300 TWh  by  2026.  Regulations  are  being  updated  to  promote  sustainable practices in current and future data centres to align them with decarbonisation strategies. A major source of data centre growth is expected to come from the rapid expansion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in Europe, 2023 vs 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nWe expect electricity demand to grow by 2.4% per year on average over the 202426 forecast period in Europe, supported by a gradual recovery in the industrial activity,  further  electrification  of  the  heating  and  transport  sectors  and  the expansion in the data centre sector.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: We expect India's share of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation (wind and solar PV) to reach 15% by 2026. In order to ensure secure electricity supply and adequately utilise high shares of renewable energy, the government announced several policy measures to promote and develop energy storage technologies. The National Electricity Plan (NEP), released by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in May 2023, estimates an energy storage requirement of 16.1 GW (7.5 GW pumped storage hydropower and 8.7 GW of batteries) by 2026-2027. Related to this, the Ministry of Power announced the preparation of a national framework for the planning and establishment of energy storage systems. Following that, viability gap  funding  (VGF)  for  4 000 MWh  of  battery  energy  storage  system  (BESS) projects was formalised. In a current tariff-based competitive bidding process, the discovered cost for BESS is INR 10.18/kWh (USD 0.12/kWh). The VGF scheme targets a reduction in the levelised cost of BESS ranging from INR 5.5/kWh to INR 6.6/kWh (USD 0.066/kWh to USD 0.079/kWh) by 2030-2031. To enable local development  of  long  duration  storage  at  a  cheaper  rate  than  BESS,  the government released new guidelines for pumped storage hydropower projects in April  this  year,  with  interstate  transmission  charges  being  waived  for  pumped storage construction awarded by June 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Global trends\n\n## Demand: Global electricity use posts strong growth to 2026\n\n## Emerging economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nGlobal electricity demand grew by a relatively modest 2.2% in 2023, down from 2.4% in 2022. Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNote: Advanced economies grouping in this chart excludes Mexico and Türkiye.\n\nStrong growth in emerging economies combined with an anticipated recovery in industry and ongoing electrification of the residential and transportation sectors in many parts of the world will be the mainstays of increasing electricity over our outlook. An important new source of higher electricity consumption is coming from energy-intensive  data  centres,  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  cryptocurrencies, which could double by 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Source: IEA analysis based on data from Eurostat and Destatis.\n\n## How much electricity does the European Union import in the form of energy-intensive goods?\n\nThe issue of reduced production of energy-intensive goods in the European Union amid high energy prices has contributed to an increase in imports in these sectors, which was particularly observable in 2022. This raises the question of how much electricity is not consumed in the European Union but is shifted to other regions and imported from there indirectly in the form of energy-intensive goods.\n\nOur analysis shows that over 160 TWh of electricity - corresponding to 6% of EU electricity demand - was indirectly imported in 2022 into the European Union in the form of energy-intensive goods made up by chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement. After an estimated 8% year-on-year increase in 2022, 2023 is expected to record a decline of 4% in indirect imports of electricity in the form of the energy-intensive goods, which can be attributed to the slowdown in EU manufacturing, weaker demand and overhang of inventories. Nevertheless, 2023 imports are still estimated to be 4% higher than the 2021 levels. This means that, in the years 2022 and 2023 combined, an additional 18 TWh of electricity was  imported  compared  to  2021  levels  in  the  form  of  energy-intensive  goods considered in our analysis, mostly due to higher primary aluminium imports.\n\n200%\n\n150%\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n-50%\n\n-100%\n\n-150%\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n\nQ3\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n## Indirect electricity imports in the form of energy-intensive goods (chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement) to the European Union by country of origin, 2019-2023\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ongoing European energy crisis, created the surge.

The  gains  largely  reflect  high household consumption and public spending on infrastructure and social services. As a result, electricity demand posted strong growth of about 4% in 2023, and is forecast at a higher annual average rate of 6% from 2024-2026, underpinned by continued robust economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Feed-in  tariffs  are  offered  for  small  power  producers  in  specific  parts  of  the country, as well as PPAs for commercial scale projects, in order to reach a quota for renewable electricity projects. However, the Thai Energy Regulatory Commission has said that there is potential for faster growth of rooftop solar if the government enacts policies to encourage private sector uptake.\n\nThailand's Power Development Plan (PDP) is typically updated or revised every few years, with the most recent revision published in 2020 (PDP 2018 Revision 1).

Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.    However,  the  per  capita  electricity consumption of households in China is still below the average for EU households.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\nIn  China,  the  post-pandemic  economic  recovery  paved  the  way  for  a  strong increase in  electricity  demand  of  6.4%  in  2023,  with  the  services  and  industry sectors  experiencing  the  most  robust  rebound.  With  the  country's  economic growth expected to slow and shift away from heavy industry, we forecast the pace of electricity demand growth to ease to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026, which is well below the average growth rate of 6.5% observed over the prepandemic  period  of  2016-2019.  Electricity  consumption  per  capita  in  China surpassed  that  of  the  European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022.  This  is,  however, propped up by the industry sector, as electricity use per household is still below that  in  the  European  Union.  The  rising  consumption  of  electricity  by  Chinese households will remain a driver of electricity demand.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the  country's  economy  undergoes  structural  changes. In  2023,  China's\n\nelectricity  demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country's economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China's electricity demand through 2026 of about 1 400 TWh is more than half of the  European  Union's  current  annual  electricity  consumption.  Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support  ongoing  electricity  demand  growth  in  China  while  the  structure  of  its economy evolves.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity demand reflected diverging trends in 2023, with advanced economies recording significant  declines,  while  emerging  market  countries,  and  especially China and India,  recorded  strong  growth  rates  on  rising  demand  for  electricity spurred by economic activity. China posted growth of 6.4% in electricity demand in  2023,  compared  to  the  3.7%  year-on-year  increase  in  2022.  Following  the easing of stringent pandemic measures at end-2022, electricity demand growth accelerated from around 3% to over 5% year-on-year by H1 2023, and continued to  rise  further  in  H2  to  close  the  year  at  over  6%.  While  construction-related industries such as glass and cement saw a slowdown in 2023, growth in Chinese electricity consumption was driven higher by the services and various industrial sectors,  including  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  the processing  of  associated  materials.  The  economy  has  shown  some  signs  of rebalancing and is expected to grow at a slower pace in the coming years. As a result, we forecast electricity demand growth at 5.1% in 2024, before gradually easing to 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026. Despite this slower pace of growth, China's increase in electricity demand of an estimated 1 400 TWh to 2026 is still more than 50% of current total annual electricity consumption of the European Union. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European  Union  at  the  end  of  2022\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: China  provides  the  largest  share  of  global  electricity  demand  growth  in terms of volume, but India posts the fastest growth rate through 2026 among major economies. Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity  demand in India rose  by  7%  in  2023  compared to last year's 8.6%. Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Data centres are significant drivers of electricity demand growth in many regions\n\nThere are currently more than 8 000 data centres globally, with about 33% of these located in the United States, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China. US data centre electricity consumption is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years, increasing from around 200 TWh in 2022 (~4% of US electricity demand), to almost 260 TWh in 2026 to account for 6% of total electricity demand. Growth will be driven by increased adoption of 5G networks and cloud-based services, as well as competitive state tax incentives.\n\nChina's State Grid Energy Research Institute expects electricity demand in the country's data centre sector to double to 400 TWh by 2030, compared to 2020. We forecast electricity consumption from data centres in China to reach around 300 TWh  by  2026.  Regulations  are  being  updated  to  promote  sustainable practices in current and future data centres to align them with decarbonisation strategies. A major source of data centre growth is expected to come from the rapid expansion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: | Emissions: CO2 from electricity sector entering a structural decline ........  61                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| China accounts for half of the decline in global power generation emissions to 2026 ............ 61                                                                                                                                                |\n| China, the United States and European Union lead declines in power sector emissions ....... 62                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Emission intensity of the power sector to fall at an unprecedented rate.................................. 63                                                                                                                                       |\n| Prices: Wholesale electricity prices fall from record highs ........................  65                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Electricity prices in many regions still remain above pre-pandemic levels .............................. 65                                                                                                                                        |\n| What does energy-intensive industry pay for electricity across the world? ............................. 69                                                                                                                                         |\n| Household electricity prices and affordability  ........................................................................... 73                                                                                                                     |\n| Reliability: Monitoring electricity security remains essential .....................  76                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Specific measures and markets for system inertia are becoming common ............................ 76                                                                                                                                               |\n| Extreme weather events caused large-scale power outages in 2023 ..................................... 78                                                                                                                                           |\n| Supply and grid issues led to major outages mostly in emerging and developing countries .. 80                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Regional focus ................................................................................  88                                                                                                                                                |\n| Asia Pacific  ......................................................................................................  88                                                                                                                           |\n| Americas  ........................................................................................................  110                                                                                                                            |\n| Europe  ............................................................................................................  121 Eurasia ...........................................................................................................  138 |\n| Middle East ....................................................................................................  142                                                                                                                              |\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## CO2 emissions from electricity generation in selected regions, 2014-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China, the United States and European Union lead declines in power sector emissions\n\nGlobal emissions from electricity generation are forecast to fall by more than 2% in 2024, followed by smaller declines of about 0.5% in both 2025 and 2026. The large contraction in emissions in 2024 assumes average weather conditions and that hydropower in China recovers from the drought-induced lows of the last three years, displacing coal and resulting in a 2.4% decline in China's emissions from electricity  generation. Followed by rapid renewables deployment and moderate demand growth, emissions in China are expected to decline by 1% per year on average in  2025-2026,  falling  back  to  2022  levels.  China  is  set  to  account  for almost half of the total decline in global emissions from power generation from 2024 to 2026.\n\nUS power sector emissions are expected to decline on average by 4% over the 2024-2026 period, led by the ongoing switch from coal to gas, and rapid growth of renewables. The country will account for one-quarter of the reductions in global power sector emissions, followed by the European Union at one-fifth of the total. EU annual reductions are forecast at an average 11% in 2024-2026.\n\nOver the outlook period, growth in electricity sector emissions is expected to come primarily  from  India,  Southeast  Asia,  and  other  emerging  economies.  The continued growth in coal-fired generation in India and Southeast Asia, combined with rising gas-fired output in the Middle East, will put upward pressure on global emissions. Nevertheless, these increases in emissions are not enough to offset large decreases expected in China, the United States and the European Union.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Continued electrification  of  China's  industrial  sector  and  strong  growth  in  road transport  (EV  charging)  accounts  for  an  increasing  share  of  China's  electricity demand over the forecast period. The rapid adoption of EVs, which now account for over 8% of the vehicles in the country, is markedly eroding growth in gasoline consumption in favour of electricity. A downward trend in the cement and glass industries  can  be  observed  since  2021,  which  is  relevant  for  the  construction sector.  By  contrast,  manufacturing  of  PV  modules,  EVs  and  processing  of associated materials were significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in the industry sector in recent years and will remain on a solid upward trend.\n\n## Indexed production output in selected industries in China, 2015-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Emissions: CO2 from electricity sector entering a structural decline\n\n## China accounts for half of the decline in global power generation emissions to 2026\n\nAfter  a  strong  rebound of  almost 8% in 2021, global emissions from electricity generation  rose  1.4%  in  2022.  Similarly,  emissions  increased  by  1%  in  2023, which is an upward revision from our previous July forecast. Fossil-fired power generation decreased in many regions in 2023, particularly in the United States and the European Union. At the same time, on a global scale, fossil-fired output remained  resilient  amid  reduced  hydropower  because  of  reasons  such  as droughts, below-normal rainfall, and low water availability due to early snowmelt. China,  India,  Viet  nam,  United  States,  Canada,  Türkiye  and  Mexico,  among others, were impacted by reduced hydropower generation. A strong increase in coal-fired output in China and India, driven by reduced hydropower and strong electricity demand growth, prevented a decline in global emissions in the electricity sector.  Nevertheless,  coal  in  China  is  expected  to  enter  a  slow  but  structural decline due  to a significant increase in renewables  deployment  and  the rebalancing of the economy. We expect global electricity sector emissions to fall 2.4% in 2024, followed by 0.5% declines of 0.5% in 2025-2026. While extreme weather,  economic  shocks  and  government  policies  could  cause  upticks  in individual years, the overall trend is expected to remain stable.\n\n## CO2 emissions from electricity generation in selected regions, 2014-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: About 85% of the additional electricity through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, mostly in People's Republic of China (hereafter, 'China'), India and Southeast Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) October 2023 outlook projects a gradual economic recovery for advanced economies, with the 2023 GDP growth rate of 1.5% followed by 1.4% in 2024 and an annual average of  1.8%  in  2025-2026.  By  contrast,  for  emerging  economies,  the  IMF  projects sustained  robust  growth  of  an  average  annual  4%,  or  slightly  higher  at  4.1%, during 2024-2026, in line with the estimated 4% in 2023.\n\nThe share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated at 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While there is progress, electrification of end uses needs to occur at a much faster pace to reach decarbonisation targets. In the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, the electricity share in final energy consumption nears 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China has the largest increase in electricity demand, while India sees the fastest growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Demand is forecast to rise by an average annual 4.6% from 2024 to 2026, with China expected to provide close to 70% of growth in the region by 2026. Asia Pacific, which accounts for just over 50% of global electricity consumption, will see renewables share of power generation rise from 27% to 35% in 2026 but coal-fired power remains the major source of supply. In 2023, coal accounted for 57% of the region's electricity generation, with lowcarbon sources such as nuclear, hydro, solar and wind contributing for 32% of the mix.  Due  to  its  strong  reliance  on  coal  for  power,  Asia  Pacific  has  the  highest electricity generation CO2 intensity of our analysed regions, at 590 g CO2/kWh in 2023, compared to a global average of 455 g CO2/kWh. The region's emissions from electricity generation are expected to record slight increases of 0.2% in 20252026, after a decline in 2024 due to an assumed recovery in hydropower.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## China\n\n## Production of solar PV modules and batteries, and processing of related materials are significant drivers of electricity demand\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%).

Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

CC BY 4.0.\n\nElectricity  demand  in  the United States ,  the  world's  second  largest  consumer behind  China,  declined  by  1.6%  in  2023,  after  2.6%  growth  in  2022.  A  major contributor to the downturn was the milder weather in 2023 compared to 2022. A slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor, albeit with significantly less impact than the weather. While record high summer temperatures in Texas drove up cooling demand, overall summer weather was milder in 2023 compared to last year. Similarly, winter months were also warmer, with the lowest number of heating degree days recorded since 2012. We forecast a moderate rebound in demand of 2.5% in 2024, assuming normal weather conditions, followed by an average growth rate of 1% in 2025-2026 due to continued electrification and strong growth in the data centre sector. We expect more than one-third of the additional US electricity demand out to 2026 to come from the expanding data centres.\n\nElectricity demand in Japan declined by 3.7% in 2023 compared to a 1% increase in 2022. Despite high temperatures boosting cooling demand in the summer, the slowdown in the manufacturing sector  and  continued  energy  saving  measures exerted strong downwards pressure on electricity consumption. However, against a backdrop of an assumed gradual recovery in the manufacturing sector in 2024 and  accelerating  electrification  of  the  transport  and  heating  sectors  over  the outlook period, a modest rebound in electricity demand of 1.2% in 2024 is forecast, followed by an average annual growth rate of 0.2% in 2025-2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: The rapid growth of renewables, supported by rising nuclear generation, is set to displace global coal-fired generation, which is forecast to fall by an average of 1.7% annually through 2026. This follows a 1.6% increase in coalfired output in 2023 amid droughts in India and China that reduced hydropower output and increased coal-fired generation, more than offsetting strong declines in coal-fired  generation  in  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union.  The  major factor  that  will  determine  the  global  outlook  is evolving  trends  in  China,  where more than half of world's coal-fired generation takes place. Coal-fired generation in China is currently on course to experience a slow structural decline, driven by the strong expansion of renewables and growing nuclear generation, as well as moderating economic growth. Despite the commissioning of new plants to boost the security of energy supply, the utilisation rate of Chinese coal-fired plants is expected  to  continue  to  fall  as  they  are  used  more  flexibly  to  complement renewables.  Nevertheless,  coal-fired  generation  in  China  will  be  influenced significantly by the pace of the economy's rebalancing, hydropower trends, and bottlenecks in integrating renewables into the country's power system.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Estimated final electricity price for large industrial customers in energy-intensive industries, 2019-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor.

The strong expansion trend of renewables is expected to result in renewable generation growing by around 20% in 2024, assuming a recovery in hydropower, and 13% on average in 2025-2026, covering  all  the  additional  Chinese  demand  growth  and  suppressing  coal-fired output.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  weather  impact,  such  as  the  reduced hydropower due to droughts as observed in recent years, can cause an uptick in Chinese coal-fired generation in individual years. However, the overall trend of coal-fired  supply  being  restrained  and  replaced by  strong  growth  in  renewable energy sources (RES) is expected to remain largely stable.\n\nGiven India 's rapid increase in demand for electricity, coal-fired power generation is expected to rise by an average 2.5% annually in 2024-2026. At the same time, renewable generation will accelerate, with an average annual growth rate of 13% over the period.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the United States, the Energy Act of 2020 requires the federal government to conduct studies on the energy and water use of data centres, to create applicable energy efficiency metrics and good practices that promote efficiency, along with public reporting of historical data centre energy and water usage. The Department of  Energy  (DOE)  is  supporting  the  local  production  of  semiconductors  and  is funding  the  development  of  more  efficient  semiconductors  over  the  next  two decades.  More  efficient  semiconductors  reduce  cooling  requirements,  thus supporting the decarbonisation of the sector. At a state level, regulators in Virginia and Oregon have already imposed requirements for better sustainability practices and carbon emissions reductions.\n\nChinese regulators will require all data centres acquired by public organisations to improve their energy efficiency and be entirely powered by renewable energy by 2032, starting with a 5% share mandate for renewables in 2023.\n\n## New fields of research can help increase efficiency and reduce energy consumption in data centres\n\nThe primary drivers of data centre electricity demand are the cooling systems and the  servers  themselves,  with  each  typically  accounting  for  40%  of  the  total consumption.  The  remaining  20%  is  consumed  by  the  power  supply  system, storage devices and communication equipment.

Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world, but it is also the sector leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Ensuring consumers have secure and affordable access to electricity while also reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the core challenges of the energy transition.\n\nGiven these trends, the International Energy Agency's Electricity 2024 is essential reading. It offers a deep and comprehensive analysis of recent policies and market developments, and provides forecasts through 2026 for electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions. The IEA's electricity sector report, which has been published regularly since 2020, provides insight into the evolving generation mix. In addition, this year's report features in-depth analysis on the drivers of recent declines in electricity  demand  in  Europe;  the  data  centre  sector's  impact  on  electricity consumption; and recent developments in the global nuclear power sector.\n\n## Acknowledgements, contributors and credits\n\nThis study was prepared by the Gas, Coal and Power Markets (GCP) Division of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Growth, however, is on course to accelerate to a higher 3.4% in our 2024-2026 forecast period, with emerging markets continuing to dominate growing electricity  demand,  as  they  did  in  2023.  The  far-ranging  repercussions  of  the energy  crisis  continued  throughout  2023,  with  elevated  inflation  levels,  high interest rates and heavy debt burdens exerting downward pressure on economies around  the  world.  Still,  emerging  market  countries  recorded  strong  growth  in electricity demand. By contrast, most advanced economies posted declines amid the  lacklustre  macroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  weak  industry  and manufacturing sectors, despite continued electrification. Milder weather compared to the previous year also exerted downward pressure on electricity consumption in some regions, including the United States.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

We expect 40 to 50 GW of new coal-fired power plant capacity to be added annually from 2024 through 2026. As the share of renewables rises, the role  of  coal-fired  plants  is  changing  from  providing  base-load  supply  to  more flexible operation. The average capacity factor of coal-fired power plants in China has come down from 61% in 2010 to 53% in 2023, and this trend is set to continue. Government authorities announced a new capacity remuneration mechanism for coal power plants, starting in January 2024, which aims to help them recover part of  their  fixed  costs  as  low-carbon generation meets an increasing share of the load.\n\nEnergy security remains a significant issue. Following power outages in 2021 and 2022, concerns emerged at the beginning of the summer of 2023 that the country would struggle to keep the lights on amid record heat waves. Summer peak load reached historic highs of 1 340 GW, up 50 GW compared to the previous year. Droughts and higher than normal temperatures from winter 2022 to spring 2023 resulted in exceptionally low water reservoir levels.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.

Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026.

Following a 7% rise in electricity demand in 2023, the growth rate is expected to average around 6.5% annually until 2026. This growth is significant as it surpasses the combined electricity consumption of Japan and Korea by the end of 2023.</p>\n\n<h2>Factors Influencing Electricity Demand</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Indias economy has been expanding swiftly, which has led to a robust demand for electricity. Increased activities in industries and residential sectors, especially for air conditioning, are key contributors to the rising demand.</li>\n    <li><strong>Climate Influences:</strong> Weather patterns, particularly temperature fluctuations, have a substantial impact on electricity consumption. For instance, India experienced the driest August in over a century, leading to increased demand for cooling and subsequent power shortages.</li>\n    <li><strong>Electrification:</strong> The ongoing electrification efforts across the country are expected to further enhance electricity consumption as more households gain access to power.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Electricity Generation Mix</h2>\n<p>Coal remains the predominant source of electricity generation in India, though its share is expected to decline from 74% in 2023 to 68% by 2026. The contribution of renewable energy is projected to grow from 21% to 25% of the total generation mix during the same period. This shift is crucial as India aims to meet its energy needs sustainably and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<h2>Projections and Future Trends</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, India is expected to add electricity demand equivalent to that of the United Kingdom over the next three years. The government anticipates that around 80 GW of additional thermal capacity will be required to meet this demand. Furthermore, the expected increase in the share of renewable energy signifies a strategic move towards cleaner energy sources, aligning with global decarbonization targets.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In summary, India's electricity consumption is on a significant upward trend, supported by economic growth, increasing electrification, and changing climatic conditions. The transition towards renewable energy sources is set to play a critical role in meeting future electricity demands while addressing environmental concerns.</p>", 'conclusion': "In conclusion, India's electricity consumption is experiencing rapid growth due to various factors, including economic expansion and increased electrification.

However, as each region is expected to experience its peak demand at different times,  power  imports  and  exports  between  regions  would  allow  for  some balancing. The country as a whole is expected to have a surplus of only 0.7% to meet the peak electricity demand (estimated at around 230 GW), indicating a tight supply  situation.  In  June  2023,  with  increasing  temperatures,  peak  demand  of 223 GW was already observed. India has installed significant  solar  generation capacities in recent years, which helps meet daytime peak demand for cooling. However, evening peaks when the sun does not shine but temperatures remain very high pose a significant challenge to the system. In such evening hours, the sufficient availability of dispatchable capacities of hydro, coal- and gas-fired power plants becomes crucial. New generation capacity additions in recent years have lagged behind the increase in peak power demand, leading the Ministry of Power in June 2023 to issue guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for electricity to ensure that generation capacity is added at a pace matching growth in demand. A new tariff scheme was also outlined, which introduces varying timeof-day tariffs between solar hours, normal hours and peak hours to incentivise the shifting of demand from the evening to daytime. The new tariffs are to come into effect during 2024 and 2025.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: India recorded a 3.8% increase in coal-fired generation in H1 2023, boosted by strong demand growth amid reduced hydropower output (-8%). With heat waves expected  to  cause  surges  in  peak  demand  due  to  increased  cooling,  the government  ordered  coal  plants  to  run  at  full  capacity  from  16  March  to  30 September  2023  to  increase  security  of  supply.  This  order  is  expected  to especially affect coal plants that use imported coal and were not operating at full capacity. Solar generation also increased strongly in H1 2023 by 26% compared to  previous  year.  We forecast coal-fired  generation  in  India  for  the  full  year  to increase by 4.2%, and to continue its increase in 2024, albeit at a slower pace of 2.5%, as renewables and nuclear are expected to expand significantly to meet a higher share of the growing electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation by source in selected regions, 2019-2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Almost two-thirds of  the  net  reduction  in  EU  electricity  demand  in  2022  is  estimated  to  be  from energy-intensive industries grappling with elevated energy prices. This trend has continued well into 2023, despite the prices for energy commodities and electricity falling from their previous record highs. As policy developments abroad courting industrial  investment  put  pressure  on  Europe's  industrial  competitiveness,  the European  Union  is  at  a  crossroads.  The  outcome  of  policy  discussions  now underway could determine the future of its energy-intensive industrial sector.\n\nThe substantial demand declines in advanced economies contrast sharply with the growth observed in emerging economies such as China and India. Japan is similarly expected to record a significant 3% fall in electricity demand in 2023, while the United States is set to see a decrease of almost 2%. In contrast, China's electricity demand is expected to increase by 5.3% in 2023 and 5.1% in 2024,  slightly  below  its  2015-2019  average  of  5.4%.  India  is  set  to  have  an average annual growth rate of 6.5% over the outlook period, surpassing its 20152019 average of 5.2%.\n\n## Declines in fossil-fired electricity generation are becoming structural\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: ## Evolution of the forecasts for peak load, availability and margin of the Indian Central Electricity Authority vs. the realised and met peak load, 2019-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Nevertheless, as shown in our recent analysis,  additional  demand  from  cooling  remains  substantial,  especially  in Southern Europe and France. In the case of unexpected unavailabilities, electricity imports will  play  a  significant  role  to  meet  demand,  as  also  highlighted  by  the ENTSO-E outlook.\n\n## Supply: Renewable generation set to overtake coal\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: Wholesale  electricity  prices  remain  elevated  in  many  countries  despite substantial declines, although there are regional differences. As prices for energy commodities such as gas and coal have fallen significantly in the first half of  2023,  wholesale  electricity  prices  in  many  regions  have  declined  from  their previous  peaks.  European  wholesale  prices  halved  from  their  record  highs  in 2022, falling closer to their 2021 average. Despite this, average prices in Europe are  still  more  than  double  2019  levels.  Similarly,  average  wholesale  electricity prices in India in the first half of 2023 were still 80% higher than 2019 levels, and in  Japan  they  were  30%  higher  compared  to  2019.  In  contrast,  wholesale electricity prices in the United States have almost fallen back to 2019 levels.\n\n## Impact of weather on electricity demand and supply is increasingly noticeable\n\nRising demand for cooling is straining the world's power systems. Summers with  extreme  temperatures  are  becoming  more  frequent  in  many  regions, elevating electricity demand for cooling systems and stretching power supplies. As more households start purchasing air conditioners, the impact will increase in many countries - especially in emerging economies that currently have a much lower share of households with AC than advanced economies with comparable climates. Setting higher efficiency standards for air conditioning would greatly help limit the impact of additional cooling demand on power systems. To ensure system reliability,  it  will  be  crucial  to  have  adequate  backup  generation  capacities, encourage demand management and energy storage, accelerate grid investments,  and  enhance  fuel  supply  security  for  power  plants.

Demand is expected to grow by slightly less than 2% in 2023, down from a rate of 2.3% in 2022 and the average annual growth rate of 2.4% observed over the 2015-2019 period. This moderation is strongly driven by declining electricity demand in advanced economies, which are dealing with the ongoing effects of the global energy crisis and slower economic growth. In 2024, as  expectations  for  the  economic  outlook  improve,  global  electricity  demand growth is forecast to rebound to 3.3%.\n\nElectricity demand in the European Union is set to decline in 2023 for the second year in a row, falling to its lowest level in two decades. EU electricity demand is expected to record a 3% drop in 2023, after already falling 3% in 2022. This  is  despite  strong  growth  in  electrification  with  a  record  number  of  electric vehicles and heat pumps sold. Following these two consecutive declines, which together amount to the region's largest slump in demand on record, EU electricity demand is set to drop to levels last seen in 2002.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n- Production curtailment\n- Permanent shutdown\n- Production resumption\n- Wholesale electricity price (3MMA)\n- Production investment abandoned or shifted abroad\n\nIEA.

Relative electricity consumption fell less than GDP (in 2009 this was the reverse) due to the lower electricity intensity of the commercial sector compared to industry.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-december-2020\nContent: The 14th five-year-plan is currently being finalised, which will guide the development of the energy sector in China to 2025 and beyond. The postCovid-19 stimulus measures to drive investment in electricity infrastructure include power generation assets, ultra-high-voltage transmission and EV charging stations. The recent announcement to the UN General Assembly of China's intention to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 will also play a key role in the 14th five-year plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## India\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 on the Indian electricity sector and electricity demand has been significant. India began a nationwide lockdown on 25 March 2020, which was relaxed progressively between the end of May and end of June. Since then local restrictions have been in place in line with local government decisions.\n\nFollowing the start of the lockdown, weather-corrected electricity demand relative to the same period in 2019 initially fell by 17%, followed by a further decline to reach a 28% reduction by the end of March. From the end of May electricity demand began to recover, reaching 2019 levels by early August, and showing year-on-year growth into September and October. Total electricity demand for 2020 is anticipated to be down 2% from last year, with a rebound expected in 2021.\n\nWeekly y-o-y demand change in India, January to November 2020, weather corrected\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

In advanced economies both sectors are responsible for roughly equal shares (around 32%). In emerging and developing economies, industry dominates by consuming around half of final demand, with the commercial and public services sector accounting for around 14%.\n\nGlobal electricity consumption is on track to fall by 2% in 2020. This is significantly less than the 5% decrease we had forecast in the Global Energy Review in April, in large part due to a strong recovery in China and to a lesser extent in India. Demand dropped by more than 3% in the first quarter due to lockdowns in China and a very mild winter in the northern hemisphere. The second quarter dip was similar: although lockdown measures depressed demand in many markets by 20% or more for several weeks, the recovery in China (demand was up 3.9% compared to the second quarter in 2019) prevented a higher global reduction. Demand recovered in the third quarter as lockdowns ended and China, responsible for 28% of the world's electricity consumption, grew by 6% year-on-year (y-o-y). Recovery in the fourth quarter has been hampered by new control measures in Europe and North America to contain the pandemic.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-december-2020\nContent: In 2020 the power market has reached two historical milestones:\n\n- \uf09f June 2020 saw the launch of the real-time power market in India, filling an important gap by providing real-time corrections (an hour ahead) for intermittent and variable generation such as solar and wind. The market has  already  seen  significant  trading  volume  and  a  large  number  of participants just a few months after market launch. The price volatility of  the  real-time  market  has  been  greater  than  that  of  the  day-ahead market, but on average prices are typically lower, at INR 2.36/kWh on average, and prices show a trend towards convergence with the dayahead market.\n- \uf09f August 2020 marked the launch of the 'Green Market' on the IEX, where green electricity is traded at a premium (compared to the regular dayahead market) at INR 3.4/kWh (within the range of INR 3-3.8/kWh) for clients looking to fulfil their Renewables Purchase Obligations through market purchases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Japan\n\nOverall electricity consumption in Japan has been declining over the past decade despite electrification in the residential, commercial and services sectors. Since the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station following the Great Japan Earthquake of 2011 and the rolling outages following it, all sectors have accelerated their energy conservation activities. These included measures such as higher set temperatures for air conditioning, reduced lighting and use of LED bulbs, as well as increased focus on energy efficiency. A relatively larger decrease in 2019 can be attributed to a mild winter and summer, resulting in reduced heating and cooling demand respectively, compared with 2018.\n\n## Y-o-y change in annual demand in Japan, 2014-2019\n\n---\nYear: market-report-december-2020\nContent: In 2020, around 70% of India's electricity is set to be generated by coalfired power plants, while renewables including hydro are also playing a significant role (23%). 2020 also sees a 4% fall in conventional generation relative to 2019, mainly driven by a decline in coal-fired generation. Gasfired generation increases by 10%, fuelled by a sharp rise in spot LNG imports and prices below USD 3 per MBtu, while gas plant capacity factors remain low. As demand fell earlier in 2020, renewable energy generation continued because of its 'must-run' status and played a larger\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrole in the electricity mix. The daily share of national generation from renewables combined (excluding large hydro) went up to 12% on 31 March, one of the highest levels of recent years. Meanwhile conventional supply including coal declined, in line with the drop in overall industrial demand.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019 solar PV and wind generation increased from 4% to 12% of annual electricity generation. At state level the picture is very diverse. Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have a higher share of solar and wind, reaching 25%, and are already facing significant system integration challenges. These include solar and wind curtailment in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, restrictions on coal generation and congestion on medium- and high-voltage transmission lines during periods of high solar and wind generation across all states. On an hourly basis solar and wind have reached levels of 60-70% of generation in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-december-2020\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regional focus: Southeast Asia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments in Southeast Asia\n\nSoutheast Asia is, in terms of electricity demand, one of the fastestgrowing regions in the world. Driven by the growing ownership of household appliances and air conditioners, as well as increasing consumption of goods and services, demand has grown by more than 6% annually over the past 20 years on average. Of the region's ten countries, the four largest by electricity consumption, Indonesia (26%), Viet Nam (22%), Thailand (19%) and Malaysia (15%), make up more than 80% of total demand in the region.\n\nThe economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the ASEAN countries is visible in reduced electricity demand, which is expected to drop by around 1% this year. For the full year, Indonesia's demand is expected to stagnate, after a reduction of almost 11% in May. Viet Nam's demand in the first ten months of the year is reported to be 3.2% above the same period of 2019 - after around 10% average growth in the past ten years. Compared to the respective periods in 2019, Thailand's demand dropped by 3.7% in the first eight months, while Malaysia's was down by 5% in the first ten months.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-december-2020\nContent: The United States and China observed a year-on-year increase in residential electricity demand in the second quarter of 2020, which can only partly be explained by higher weather-induced heating and cooling energy demand.\n\nDecreasing economic activity throughout the first and second quarters of 2020 can be detected in most European countries. Industrial activity saw a significant drop, mainly in the second quarter, in Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Manufacturing activity was significantly down in Germany, partly due to reduced production in the car industry (responsible for around 19% of GDP in the German manufacturing sector). Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, saw their most significant decrease in economic activity in the wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food service activities.\n\nThe third quarter of 2020 saw a recovery in electricity demand in commercial and industry sectors in the United States, Spain and Argentina. Nonetheless, consumption was still below 2019 levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Y-o-y changes in electricity demand in the first three quarters of 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies.

Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## Electricity demand in selected regions, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn India , following robust growth over 8% in 2023, the strong economy, expanding industrial  activity  and  intense  heatwaves  combined to boost electricity demand growth  by  8.5%  y-o-y  in  the  first  half  of  2024.  We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. Indian per capita electricity consumption is currently 20% of that in the European  Union.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Electricity demand in China is forecast to increase by 6.5% in 2024, similar to  its  average  rate  between  2016  and  2019. This  still  strong  annual  growth represents a modest slowdown from 7% in 2023 amid the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy. Electricity consumption in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by robust activity in the services industries and various industrial sectors, including a rapid rise in solar PV, electric vehicle (EV) and battery production, and the electricity-intensive processing of related materials. Continued expansion of 5G networks and data centres as well as strong EV uptake in the domestic market are also contributing factors. Over the last three years, China has been adding electricity demand roughly equivalent to that of Germany each year, on average, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025, with growth forecast at 6.2%.\n\nIndia, the fastest growing major economy in the world, is forecast to post an 8% rise in electricity consumption in 2024, matching the rapid growth it saw in 2023. This is supported by strong GDP growth and increased cooling demand due to long and intense heatwaves. In the first half of 2024, the country grappled with heatwaves of record duration, with peak load reaching a new high and putting exceptional  strains  on  power  systems.  Assuming  a  return  to  average  weather conditions, we expect electricity demand growth in India to ease moderately to 6.8% in 2025.\n\nElectricity  demand in  the  United  States  is  set  to  rebound  significantly  in 2024, increasing by 3% year-on-year . The stronger growth rate is due, in part, to the comparison with 2023 when demand declined by 1.6% amid mild weather.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## India's summer electricity demand surges amidst prolonged heatwaves\n\nIn early 2024, India grappled with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, driven by extreme heatwaves as well as strong growth in industrial and residential power  consumption.  During this period, the government  took emergency measures  to  manage  the  situation,  including  deferring  plant  maintenance  and reopening idled coal units. India also extended the operation of imported coalbased power plants until mid-October from the previous directive through June 2024. Additionally, the government considered similar mandates for gas-based power plants to further enhance capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late May, India issued a heatwave alert as New Delhi saw temperatures soaring to 49°C. Just a day later, on May 30, 2024, India met an unprecedented maximum power demand of 250 GW driven by intense heat, expanding industrial activities, and  heightened  residential  power  consumption.  This  heatwave  has  been  the longest ever in duration to affect the country, enduring for approximately 24 days in various regions.\n\nDespite  this  surge  in  demand,  the  national  electricity  transmission  network remained stable, with no unscheduled interruptions reported. A peak demand of 258 GW for the rest of 2024 is expected. At the same time, the ability to meet electricity  demand  has  been  improving  over  the  last  few  years.  The  share  of demand that was unmet showed an overall declining trend since the second half of 2022, which continued well into H1 2024.\n\n## Electricity demand from data centres is in focus with the rise of artificial intelligence\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026.

After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies.

Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## Electricity demand in selected regions, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn India , following robust growth over 8% in 2023, the strong economy, expanding industrial  activity  and  intense  heatwaves  combined to boost electricity demand growth  by  8.5%  y-o-y  in  the  first  half  of  2024.  We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. Indian per capita electricity consumption is currently 20% of that in the European  Union.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Electricity demand in China is forecast to increase by 6.5% in 2024, similar to  its  average  rate  between  2016  and  2019. This  still  strong  annual  growth represents a modest slowdown from 7% in 2023 amid the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy. Electricity consumption in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by robust activity in the services industries and various industrial sectors, including a rapid rise in solar PV, electric vehicle (EV) and battery production, and the electricity-intensive processing of related materials. Continued expansion of 5G networks and data centres as well as strong EV uptake in the domestic market are also contributing factors. Over the last three years, China has been adding electricity demand roughly equivalent to that of Germany each year, on average, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025, with growth forecast at 6.2%.\n\nIndia, the fastest growing major economy in the world, is forecast to post an 8% rise in electricity consumption in 2024, matching the rapid growth it saw in 2023. This is supported by strong GDP growth and increased cooling demand due to long and intense heatwaves. In the first half of 2024, the country grappled with heatwaves of record duration, with peak load reaching a new high and putting exceptional  strains  on  power  systems.  Assuming  a  return  to  average  weather conditions, we expect electricity demand growth in India to ease moderately to 6.8% in 2025.\n\nElectricity  demand in  the  United  States  is  set  to  rebound  significantly  in 2024, increasing by 3% year-on-year . The stronger growth rate is due, in part, to the comparison with 2023 when demand declined by 1.6% amid mild weather.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## India's summer electricity demand surges amidst prolonged heatwaves\n\nIn early 2024, India grappled with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, driven by extreme heatwaves as well as strong growth in industrial and residential power  consumption.  During this period, the government  took emergency measures  to  manage  the  situation,  including  deferring  plant  maintenance  and reopening idled coal units. India also extended the operation of imported coalbased power plants until mid-October from the previous directive through June 2024. Additionally, the government considered similar mandates for gas-based power plants to further enhance capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late May, India issued a heatwave alert as New Delhi saw temperatures soaring to 49°C. Just a day later, on May 30, 2024, India met an unprecedented maximum power demand of 250 GW driven by intense heat, expanding industrial activities, and  heightened  residential  power  consumption.  This  heatwave  has  been  the longest ever in duration to affect the country, enduring for approximately 24 days in various regions.\n\nDespite  this  surge  in  demand,  the  national  electricity  transmission  network remained stable, with no unscheduled interruptions reported. A peak demand of 258 GW for the rest of 2024 is expected. At the same time, the ability to meet electricity  demand  has  been  improving  over  the  last  few  years.  The  share  of demand that was unmet showed an overall declining trend since the second half of 2022, which continued well into H1 2024.\n\n## Electricity demand from data centres is in focus with the rise of artificial intelligence\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies.

Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## Electricity demand in selected regions, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn India , following robust growth over 8% in 2023, the strong economy, expanding industrial  activity  and  intense  heatwaves  combined to boost electricity demand growth  by  8.5%  y-o-y  in  the  first  half  of  2024.  We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. Indian per capita electricity consumption is currently 20% of that in the European  Union.  Along  with  strong  economic  activity,  purchasing  of  new appliances and air conditioning units will continue to support electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The figures for 2024 and 2025 are forecast values.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Electricity demand in China is forecast to increase by 6.5% in 2024, similar to  its  average  rate  between  2016  and  2019. This  still  strong  annual  growth represents a modest slowdown from 7% in 2023 amid the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy. Electricity consumption in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by robust activity in the services industries and various industrial sectors, including a rapid rise in solar PV, electric vehicle (EV) and battery production, and the electricity-intensive processing of related materials. Continued expansion of 5G networks and data centres as well as strong EV uptake in the domestic market are also contributing factors. Over the last three years, China has been adding electricity demand roughly equivalent to that of Germany each year, on average, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025, with growth forecast at 6.2%.\n\nIndia, the fastest growing major economy in the world, is forecast to post an 8% rise in electricity consumption in 2024, matching the rapid growth it saw in 2023. This is supported by strong GDP growth and increased cooling demand due to long and intense heatwaves. In the first half of 2024, the country grappled with heatwaves of record duration, with peak load reaching a new high and putting exceptional  strains  on  power  systems.  Assuming  a  return  to  average  weather conditions, we expect electricity demand growth in India to ease moderately to 6.8% in 2025.\n\nElectricity  demand in  the  United  States  is  set  to  rebound  significantly  in 2024, increasing by 3% year-on-year . The stronger growth rate is due, in part, to the comparison with 2023 when demand declined by 1.6% amid mild weather.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## India's summer electricity demand surges amidst prolonged heatwaves\n\nIn early 2024, India grappled with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, driven by extreme heatwaves as well as strong growth in industrial and residential power  consumption.  During this period, the government  took emergency measures  to  manage  the  situation,  including  deferring  plant  maintenance  and reopening idled coal units. India also extended the operation of imported coalbased power plants until mid-October from the previous directive through June 2024. Additionally, the government considered similar mandates for gas-based power plants to further enhance capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late May, India issued a heatwave alert as New Delhi saw temperatures soaring to 49°C. Just a day later, on May 30, 2024, India met an unprecedented maximum power demand of 250 GW driven by intense heat, expanding industrial activities, and  heightened  residential  power  consumption.  This  heatwave  has  been  the longest ever in duration to affect the country, enduring for approximately 24 days in various regions.\n\nDespite  this  surge  in  demand,  the  national  electricity  transmission  network remained stable, with no unscheduled interruptions reported. A peak demand of 258 GW for the rest of 2024 is expected. At the same time, the ability to meet electricity  demand  has  been  improving  over  the  last  few  years.  The  share  of demand that was unmet showed an overall declining trend since the second half of 2022, which continued well into H1 2024.\n\n## Electricity demand from data centres is in focus with the rise of artificial intelligence\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

This economic activity is a primary driver of increased electricity consumption.</li>\n<li><strong>Weather Conditions:</strong> The first half of 2024 has witnessed unprecedented heatwaves, significantly increasing the demand for electricity as residential and industrial sectors require more energy for cooling and operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Industrial Activity:</strong> The growth in industrial output has led to higher electricity consumption, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing, which require substantial energy inputs.</li>\n<li><strong>Electrification Trends:</strong> Increased electrification across urban and rural areas, including the adoption of air conditioning and electric appliances, has further contributed to the rising demand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Projected Growth and Challenges</h2>\n\n<p>India's electricity demand is expected to see a compound growth rate of 6.5% annually through 2026, supported by both economic factors and infrastructural developments. However, challenges remain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coal Dependency:</strong> While renewable energy sources are projected to meet a growing share of electricity demand, coal remains a dominant source of energy. Approximately 68% of total electricity generation in 2026 is expected to come from coal-fired power plants, necessitating a balanced approach to energy production.</li>\n<li><strong>Infrastructure Strain:</strong> The unprecedented demand spikes during heatwaves have led to increased pressure on India's electricity grid. Emergency measures, such as deferring maintenance on power plants and reopening coal units, have been implemented to manage these surges.</li>\n<li><strong>Renewable Energy Integration:</strong> As India aims to increase the share of renewables in its energy mix to 25% by 2026, the transition will require substantial investment in infrastructure and technology to ensure stability and reliability in energy supply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In summary, India is experiencing a significant surge in electricity consumption, driven by economic growth, rising temperatures, and increased industrial activity. The transition towards renewable energy is underway, yet challenges related to coal dependency and infrastructure capacity must be addressed to sustain this growth. The outlook for 2024 is positive, with expectations for continued expansion in both demand and supply of electricity.</p>", 'sources': '- International Energy Agency (IEA) Reports\n- International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook\n- Various articles and reports on electricity consumption trends in India from credible news sources.', 'image_path': 'https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-A5lK4x60hfnXqG1cxR9MAf5K/user-oydwKlgqC7EGEVn7K0pZcSgz/img-dgx1rQrLLxII6PBLJmxr1mDI.png?st=2025-03-31T19%3A10%3A57Z&se=2025-03-31T21%3A10%3A57Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=d505667d-d6c1-4a0a-bac7-5c84a87759f8&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-03-30T22%3A10%3A06Z&ske=2025-03-31T22%3A10%3A06Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=QB0Doq9KW7nVxlV3LjnO1nkFbNpS%2BguMtkL9tbUs4/s%3D'}, log='')]}

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies.

Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## Electricity demand in selected regions, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn India , following robust growth over 8% in 2023, the strong economy, expanding industrial  activity  and  intense  heatwaves  combined to boost electricity demand growth  by  8.5%  y-o-y  in  the  first  half  of  2024.  We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. Indian per capita electricity consumption is currently 20% of that in the European  Union.  Along  with  strong  economic  activity,  purchasing  of  new appliances and air conditioning units will continue to support electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The figures for 2024 and 2025 are forecast values.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Electricity demand in China is forecast to increase by 6.5% in 2024, similar to  its  average  rate  between  2016  and  2019. This  still  strong  annual  growth represents a modest slowdown from 7% in 2023 amid the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy. Electricity consumption in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by robust activity in the services industries and various industrial sectors, including a rapid rise in solar PV, electric vehicle (EV) and battery production, and the electricity-intensive processing of related materials. Continued expansion of 5G networks and data centres as well as strong EV uptake in the domestic market are also contributing factors. Over the last three years, China has been adding electricity demand roughly equivalent to that of Germany each year, on average, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025, with growth forecast at 6.2%.\n\nIndia, the fastest growing major economy in the world, is forecast to post an 8% rise in electricity consumption in 2024, matching the rapid growth it saw in 2023. This is supported by strong GDP growth and increased cooling demand due to long and intense heatwaves. In the first half of 2024, the country grappled with heatwaves of record duration, with peak load reaching a new high and putting exceptional  strains  on  power  systems.  Assuming  a  return  to  average  weather conditions, we expect electricity demand growth in India to ease moderately to 6.8% in 2025.\n\nElectricity  demand in  the  United  States  is  set  to  rebound  significantly  in 2024, increasing by 3% year-on-year . The stronger growth rate is due, in part, to the comparison with 2023 when demand declined by 1.6% amid mild weather.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## India's summer electricity demand surges amidst prolonged heatwaves\n\nIn early 2024, India grappled with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, driven by extreme heatwaves as well as strong growth in industrial and residential power  consumption.  During this period, the government  took emergency measures  to  manage  the  situation,  including  deferring  plant  maintenance  and reopening idled coal units. India also extended the operation of imported coalbased power plants until mid-October from the previous directive through June 2024. Additionally, the government considered similar mandates for gas-based power plants to further enhance capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late May, India issued a heatwave alert as New Delhi saw temperatures soaring to 49°C. Just a day later, on May 30, 2024, India met an unprecedented maximum power demand of 250 GW driven by intense heat, expanding industrial activities, and  heightened  residential  power  consumption.  This  heatwave  has  been  the longest ever in duration to affect the country, enduring for approximately 24 days in various regions.\n\nDespite  this  surge  in  demand,  the  national  electricity  transmission  network remained stable, with no unscheduled interruptions reported. A peak demand of 258 GW for the rest of 2024 is expected. At the same time, the ability to meet electricity  demand  has  been  improving  over  the  last  few  years.  The  share  of demand that was unmet showed an overall declining trend since the second half of 2022, which continued well into H1 2024.\n\n## Electricity demand from data centres is in focus with the rise of artificial intelligence\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

However, as each region is expected to experience its peak demand at different times,  power  imports  and  exports  between  regions  would  allow  for  some balancing. The country as a whole is expected to have a surplus of only 0.7% to meet the peak electricity demand (estimated at around 230 GW), indicating a tight supply  situation.  In  June  2023,  with  increasing  temperatures,  peak  demand  of 223 GW was already observed. India has installed significant  solar  generation capacities in recent years, which helps meet daytime peak demand for cooling. However, evening peaks when the sun does not shine but temperatures remain very high pose a significant challenge to the system. In such evening hours, the sufficient availability of dispatchable capacities of hydro, coal- and gas-fired power plants becomes crucial. New generation capacity additions in recent years have lagged behind the increase in peak power demand, leading the Ministry of Power in June 2023 to issue guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for electricity to ensure that generation capacity is added at a pace matching growth in demand. A new tariff scheme was also outlined, which introduces varying timeof-day tariffs between solar hours, normal hours and peak hours to incentivise the shifting of demand from the evening to daytime. The new tariffs are to come into effect during 2024 and 2025.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: India recorded a 3.8% increase in coal-fired generation in H1 2023, boosted by strong demand growth amid reduced hydropower output (-8%). With heat waves expected  to  cause  surges  in  peak  demand  due  to  increased  cooling,  the government  ordered  coal  plants  to  run  at  full  capacity  from  16  March  to  30 September  2023  to  increase  security  of  supply.  This  order  is  expected  to especially affect coal plants that use imported coal and were not operating at full capacity. Solar generation also increased strongly in H1 2023 by 26% compared to  previous  year.  We forecast coal-fired  generation  in  India  for  the  full  year  to increase by 4.2%, and to continue its increase in 2024, albeit at a slower pace of 2.5%, as renewables and nuclear are expected to expand significantly to meet a higher share of the growing electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation by source in selected regions, 2019-2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Although  the  economic  rebound  following  the  easing  of  strict  pandemic restrictions has not been as strong as some had anticipated, increasing cooling demand in the summer of 2023 is expected to further boost electricity demand.

Growth of 6.1% is forecast in 2024, by when India's electricity consumption is expected to surpass that of Japan and Korea combined.

Almost two-thirds of  the  net  reduction  in  EU  electricity  demand  in  2022  is  estimated  to  be  from energy-intensive industries grappling with elevated energy prices. This trend has continued well into 2023, despite the prices for energy commodities and electricity falling from their previous record highs. As policy developments abroad courting industrial  investment  put  pressure  on  Europe's  industrial  competitiveness,  the European  Union  is  at  a  crossroads.  The  outcome  of  policy  discussions  now underway could determine the future of its energy-intensive industrial sector.\n\nThe substantial demand declines in advanced economies contrast sharply with the growth observed in emerging economies such as China and India. Japan is similarly expected to record a significant 3% fall in electricity demand in 2023, while the United States is set to see a decrease of almost 2%. In contrast, China's electricity demand is expected to increase by 5.3% in 2023 and 5.1% in 2024,  slightly  below  its  2015-2019  average  of  5.4%.  India  is  set  to  have  an average annual growth rate of 6.5% over the outlook period, surpassing its 20152019 average of 5.2%.\n\n## Declines in fossil-fired electricity generation are becoming structural\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: ## Evolution of the forecasts for peak load, availability and margin of the Indian Central Electricity Authority vs. the realised and met peak load, 2019-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Nevertheless, as shown in our recent analysis,  additional  demand  from  cooling  remains  substantial,  especially  in Southern Europe and France. In the case of unexpected unavailabilities, electricity imports will  play  a  significant  role  to  meet  demand,  as  also  highlighted  by  the ENTSO-E outlook.\n\n## Supply: Renewable generation set to overtake coal\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: Wholesale  electricity  prices  remain  elevated  in  many  countries  despite substantial declines, although there are regional differences. As prices for energy commodities such as gas and coal have fallen significantly in the first half of  2023,  wholesale  electricity  prices  in  many  regions  have  declined  from  their previous  peaks.  European  wholesale  prices  halved  from  their  record  highs  in 2022, falling closer to their 2021 average. Despite this, average prices in Europe are  still  more  than  double  2019  levels.  Similarly,  average  wholesale  electricity prices in India in the first half of 2023 were still 80% higher than 2019 levels, and in  Japan  they  were  30%  higher  compared  to  2019.  In  contrast,  wholesale electricity prices in the United States have almost fallen back to 2019 levels.\n\n## Impact of weather on electricity demand and supply is increasingly noticeable\n\nRising demand for cooling is straining the world's power systems. Summers with  extreme  temperatures  are  becoming  more  frequent  in  many  regions, elevating electricity demand for cooling systems and stretching power supplies. As more households start purchasing air conditioners, the impact will increase in many countries - especially in emerging economies that currently have a much lower share of households with AC than advanced economies with comparable climates. Setting higher efficiency standards for air conditioning would greatly help limit the impact of additional cooling demand on power systems. To ensure system reliability,  it  will  be  crucial  to  have  adequate  backup  generation  capacities, encourage demand management and energy storage, accelerate grid investments,  and  enhance  fuel  supply  security  for  power  plants.

Demand is expected to grow by slightly less than 2% in 2023, down from a rate of 2.3% in 2022 and the average annual growth rate of 2.4% observed over the 2015-2019 period. This moderation is strongly driven by declining electricity demand in advanced economies, which are dealing with the ongoing effects of the global energy crisis and slower economic growth. In 2024, as  expectations  for  the  economic  outlook  improve,  global  electricity  demand growth is forecast to rebound to 3.3%.\n\nElectricity demand in the European Union is set to decline in 2023 for the second year in a row, falling to its lowest level in two decades. EU electricity demand is expected to record a 3% drop in 2023, after already falling 3% in 2022. This  is  despite  strong  growth  in  electrification  with  a  record  number  of  electric vehicles and heat pumps sold. Following these two consecutive declines, which together amount to the region's largest slump in demand on record, EU electricity demand is set to drop to levels last seen in 2002.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n- Production curtailment\n- Permanent shutdown\n- Production resumption\n- Wholesale electricity price (3MMA)\n- Production investment abandoned or shifted abroad\n\nIEA.

It should also be noted that in some industries that consume large amounts of electricity, gas has a higher share of energy consumption (e.g., glass industry) or is used as a feedstock (e.g., chemical industry). In these industries, the price of gas plays a more significant role in costs and operational decisions than the electricity price.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption in India', 'year': '2024'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption in India', 'year': '2024'}, log="Year: 2024\nContent: Electricity  demand in India rose  by  7%  in  2023  compared to last year's 8.6%. Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## Electricity demand in selected regions, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn India , following robust growth over 8% in 2023, the strong economy, expanding industrial  activity  and  intense  heatwaves  combined to boost electricity demand growth  by  8.5%  y-o-y  in  the  first  half  of  2024.  We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. Indian per capita electricity consumption is currently 20% of that in the European  Union.  Along  with  strong  economic  activity,  purchasing  of  new appliances and air conditioning units will continue to support electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The figures for 2024 and 2025 are forecast values.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Electricity demand in China is forecast to increase by 6.5% in 2024, similar to  its  average  rate  between  2016  and  2019. This  still  strong  annual  growth represents a modest slowdown from 7% in 2023 amid the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy. Electricity consumption in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by robust activity in the services industries and various industrial sectors, including a rapid rise in solar PV, electric vehicle (EV) and battery production, and the electricity-intensive processing of related materials. Continued expansion of 5G networks and data centres as well as strong EV uptake in the domestic market are also contributing factors. Over the last three years, China has been adding electricity demand roughly equivalent to that of Germany each year, on average, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025, with growth forecast at 6.2%.\n\nIndia, the fastest growing major economy in the world, is forecast to post an 8% rise in electricity consumption in 2024, matching the rapid growth it saw in 2023. This is supported by strong GDP growth and increased cooling demand due to long and intense heatwaves. In the first half of 2024, the country grappled with heatwaves of record duration, with peak load reaching a new high and putting exceptional  strains  on  power  systems.  Assuming  a  return  to  average  weather conditions, we expect electricity demand growth in India to ease moderately to 6.8% in 2025.\n\nElectricity  demand in  the  United  States  is  set  to  rebound  significantly  in 2024, increasing by 3% year-on-year . The stronger growth rate is due, in part, to the comparison with 2023 when demand declined by 1.6% amid mild weather.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## India's summer electricity demand surges amidst prolonged heatwaves\n\nIn early 2024, India grappled with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, driven by extreme heatwaves as well as strong growth in industrial and residential power  consumption.  During this period, the government  took emergency measures  to  manage  the  situation,  including  deferring  plant  maintenance  and reopening idled coal units. India also extended the operation of imported coalbased power plants until mid-October from the previous directive through June 2024. Additionally, the government considered similar mandates for gas-based power plants to further enhance capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late May, India issued a heatwave alert as New Delhi saw temperatures soaring to 49°C. Just a day later, on May 30, 2024, India met an unprecedented maximum power demand of 250 GW driven by intense heat, expanding industrial activities, and  heightened  residential  power  consumption.  This  heatwave  has  been  the longest ever in duration to affect the country, enduring for approximately 24 days in various regions.\n\nDespite  this  surge  in  demand,  the  national  electricity  transmission  network remained stable, with no unscheduled interruptions reported. A peak demand of 258 GW for the rest of 2024 is expected. At the same time, the ability to meet electricity  demand  has  been  improving  over  the  last  few  years.  The  share  of demand that was unmet showed an overall declining trend since the second half of 2022, which continued well into H1 2024.\n\n## Electricity demand from data centres is in focus with the rise of artificial intelligence\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household.

CC BY 4.0.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on data from Load Generation Balance Reports of the Indian Central Electricity Authority and ERCOT\n\nIn India , Central Electricity Authority's Load Generation Balance Report 2023-24, published  in  March  2023,  estimates  that  sub-regions  in  India  may  face  power supply  deficits  ranging  from  4%  to  11.3%  of  their  respective  peak  demand. However, as each region is expected to experience its peak demand at different times,  power  imports  and  exports  between  regions  would  allow  for  some balancing. The country as a whole is expected to have a surplus of only 0.7% to meet the peak electricity demand (estimated at around 230 GW), indicating a tight supply  situation.  In  June  2023,  with  increasing  temperatures,  peak  demand  of 223 GW was already observed. India has installed significant  solar  generation capacities in recent years, which helps meet daytime peak demand for cooling. However, evening peaks when the sun does not shine but temperatures remain very high pose a significant challenge to the system. In such evening hours, the sufficient availability of dispatchable capacities of hydro, coal- and gas-fired power plants becomes crucial. New generation capacity additions in recent years have lagged behind the increase in peak power demand, leading the Ministry of Power in June 2023 to issue guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for electricity to ensure that generation capacity is added at a pace matching growth in demand. A new tariff scheme was also outlined, which introduces varying timeof-day tariffs between solar hours, normal hours and peak hours to incentivise the shifting of demand from the evening to daytime. The new tariffs are to come into effect during 2024 and 2025.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: India recorded a 3.8% increase in coal-fired generation in H1 2023, boosted by strong demand growth amid reduced hydropower output (-8%). With heat waves expected  to  cause  surges  in  peak  demand  due  to  increased  cooling,  the government  ordered  coal  plants  to  run  at  full  capacity  from  16  March  to  30 September  2023  to  increase  security  of  supply.  This  order  is  expected  to especially affect coal plants that use imported coal and were not operating at full capacity. Solar generation also increased strongly in H1 2023 by 26% compared to  previous  year.  We forecast coal-fired  generation  in  India  for  the  full  year  to increase by 4.2%, and to continue its increase in 2024, albeit at a slower pace of 2.5%, as renewables and nuclear are expected to expand significantly to meet a higher share of the growing electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation by source in selected regions, 2019-2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Although  the  economic  rebound  following  the  easing  of  strict  pandemic restrictions has not been as strong as some had anticipated, increasing cooling demand in the summer of 2023 is expected to further boost electricity demand.

Growth of 6.1% is forecast in 2024, by when India's electricity consumption is expected to surpass that of Japan and Korea combined.

Almost two-thirds of  the  net  reduction  in  EU  electricity  demand  in  2022  is  estimated  to  be  from energy-intensive industries grappling with elevated energy prices. This trend has continued well into 2023, despite the prices for energy commodities and electricity falling from their previous record highs. As policy developments abroad courting industrial  investment  put  pressure  on  Europe's  industrial  competitiveness,  the European  Union  is  at  a  crossroads.  The  outcome  of  policy  discussions  now underway could determine the future of its energy-intensive industrial sector.\n\nThe substantial demand declines in advanced economies contrast sharply with the growth observed in emerging economies such as China and India. Japan is similarly expected to record a significant 3% fall in electricity demand in 2023, while the United States is set to see a decrease of almost 2%. In contrast, China's electricity demand is expected to increase by 5.3% in 2023 and 5.1% in 2024,  slightly  below  its  2015-2019  average  of  5.4%.

Nevertheless, as shown in our recent analysis,  additional  demand  from  cooling  remains  substantial,  especially  in Southern Europe and France. In the case of unexpected unavailabilities, electricity imports will  play  a  significant  role  to  meet  demand,  as  also  highlighted  by  the ENTSO-E outlook.\n\n## Supply: Renewable generation set to overtake coal\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: Wholesale  electricity  prices  remain  elevated  in  many  countries  despite substantial declines, although there are regional differences. As prices for energy commodities such as gas and coal have fallen significantly in the first half of  2023,  wholesale  electricity  prices  in  many  regions  have  declined  from  their previous  peaks.  European  wholesale  prices  halved  from  their  record  highs  in 2022, falling closer to their 2021 average. Despite this, average prices in Europe are  still  more  than  double  2019  levels.  Similarly,  average  wholesale  electricity prices in India in the first half of 2023 were still 80% higher than 2019 levels, and in  Japan  they  were  30%  higher  compared  to  2019.  In  contrast,  wholesale electricity prices in the United States have almost fallen back to 2019 levels.\n\n## Impact of weather on electricity demand and supply is increasingly noticeable\n\nRising demand for cooling is straining the world's power systems. Summers with  extreme  temperatures  are  becoming  more  frequent  in  many  regions, elevating electricity demand for cooling systems and stretching power supplies. As more households start purchasing air conditioners, the impact will increase in many countries - especially in emerging economies that currently have a much lower share of households with AC than advanced economies with comparable climates. Setting higher efficiency standards for air conditioning would greatly help limit the impact of additional cooling demand on power systems. To ensure system reliability,  it  will  be  crucial  to  have  adequate  backup  generation  capacities, encourage demand management and energy storage, accelerate grid investments,  and  enhance  fuel  supply  security  for  power  plants.

Demand is expected to grow by slightly less than 2% in 2023, down from a rate of 2.3% in 2022 and the average annual growth rate of 2.4% observed over the 2015-2019 period. This moderation is strongly driven by declining electricity demand in advanced economies, which are dealing with the ongoing effects of the global energy crisis and slower economic growth. In 2024, as  expectations  for  the  economic  outlook  improve,  global  electricity  demand growth is forecast to rebound to 3.3%.\n\nElectricity demand in the European Union is set to decline in 2023 for the second year in a row, falling to its lowest level in two decades. EU electricity demand is expected to record a 3% drop in 2023, after already falling 3% in 2022. This  is  despite  strong  growth  in  electrification  with  a  record  number  of  electric vehicles and heat pumps sold. Following these two consecutive declines, which together amount to the region's largest slump in demand on record, EU electricity demand is set to drop to levels last seen in 2002.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n- Production curtailment\n- Permanent shutdown\n- Production resumption\n- Wholesale electricity price (3MMA)\n- Production investment abandoned or shifted abroad\n\nIEA.

We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. Indian per capita electricity consumption is currently 20% of that in the European  Union.  Along  with  strong  economic  activity,  purchasing  of  new appliances and air conditioning units will continue to support electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The figures for 2024 and 2025 are forecast values.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Electricity demand in China is forecast to increase by 6.5% in 2024, similar to  its  average  rate  between  2016  and  2019. This  still  strong  annual  growth represents a modest slowdown from 7% in 2023 amid the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy. Electricity consumption in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by robust activity in the services industries and various industrial sectors, including a rapid rise in solar PV, electric vehicle (EV) and battery production, and the electricity-intensive processing of related materials. Continued expansion of 5G networks and data centres as well as strong EV uptake in the domestic market are also contributing factors. Over the last three years, China has been adding electricity demand roughly equivalent to that of Germany each year, on average, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025, with growth forecast at 6.2%.\n\nIndia, the fastest growing major economy in the world, is forecast to post an 8% rise in electricity consumption in 2024, matching the rapid growth it saw in 2023. This is supported by strong GDP growth and increased cooling demand due to long and intense heatwaves. In the first half of 2024, the country grappled with heatwaves of record duration, with peak load reaching a new high and putting exceptional  strains  on  power  systems.  Assuming  a  return  to  average  weather conditions, we expect electricity demand growth in India to ease moderately to 6.8% in 2025.\n\nElectricity  demand in  the  United  States  is  set  to  rebound  significantly  in 2024, increasing by 3% year-on-year . The stronger growth rate is due, in part, to the comparison with 2023 when demand declined by 1.6% amid mild weather.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## India's summer electricity demand surges amidst prolonged heatwaves\n\nIn early 2024, India grappled with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, driven by extreme heatwaves as well as strong growth in industrial and residential power  consumption.  During this period, the government  took emergency measures  to  manage  the  situation,  including  deferring  plant  maintenance  and reopening idled coal units. India also extended the operation of imported coalbased power plants until mid-October from the previous directive through June 2024. Additionally, the government considered similar mandates for gas-based power plants to further enhance capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late May, India issued a heatwave alert as New Delhi saw temperatures soaring to 49°C. Just a day later, on May 30, 2024, India met an unprecedented maximum power demand of 250 GW driven by intense heat, expanding industrial activities, and  heightened  residential  power  consumption.  This  heatwave  has  been  the longest ever in duration to affect the country, enduring for approximately 24 days in various regions.\n\nDespite  this  surge  in  demand,  the  national  electricity  transmission  network remained stable, with no unscheduled interruptions reported. A peak demand of 258 GW for the rest of 2024 is expected. At the same time, the ability to meet electricity  demand  has  been  improving  over  the  last  few  years.  The  share  of demand that was unmet showed an overall declining trend since the second half of 2022, which continued well into H1 2024.\n\n## Electricity demand from data centres is in focus with the rise of artificial intelligence\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

As a result, electricity demand in these sectors rose by around 60-65% between  2014  and  2024.  While  good  interconnections  among  states  and  the operation of thermal power plants allow Indian utilities to cover demand in energy terms throughout the year, the rapid increase in yearly peak load poses a major challenge for the electricity grid and national authorities.\n\nEven  though  less  than  20%  of  households  in  India  are  equipped  with  an  air conditioner, the contribution of cooling to total peak load is estimated at 60 GW in 2024, as sales reached a new record of 14 million AC units sold in 2024. This is 27%  more  than  in  2023,  when  11 million  units  were  sold.  By  2030,  cooling equipment is expected to contribute one-third to the peak electricity load in India, potentially reaching 140 GW.

Peak electricity load in India has shown strong growth in recent years, and a dedicated section in this chapter provides a detailed analysis of peak load trends and the successful impact of India's time-of-use tariffs.\n\nElectricity demand  in  advanced  economies,  in  aggregate,  was  effectively unchanged in 2024 compared to 2021. During this period, the growth in global electricity demand has come from emerging economies and developing markets. However, through 2027, we expect the share of advanced economies in additional electricity demand to increase to around 15%, as electrification of the transport and  heating  sectors  continues,  and  data  centres  expand  rapidly.  While  in  the United  States  the  growth  projections  for  data  centres  are  a  key  driver  of  the electricity  demand  trends,  in  the  European  Union  uncertainty  surrounding  the recovery in energy-intensive industries and the impact on electricity demand is a central topic and is covered in detail.\n\n## Change in electricity demand by region, 202 1 -2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Similarly, the 2024 Action Plan included goals to increase the share of clean energy  in  data  centres'  electricity  consumption,  setting  targets  for  the  overall utilisation rate of renewable energy to increase by 10% annually for data centres and for EDWC data centres to source at least 80% of their electricity consumption from renewables by 2025.\n\n## Strong growth in peak electricity load in India amid economic growth and rising AC usage\n\nFollowing a strong 8.3% increase in 2023, electricity demand in India grew 5.8% y-o-y in 2024 amid strong economic growth. While electricity consumption rose by a robust 8.5% during the first half of the year due to intense and long heatwaves, the  second  half  saw  a  more  subdued  growth  in  demand  amid milder  weather. Supported  by  rapid  economic  expansion  and  increasing  electrification,  India's electricity demand is forecast to grow at a high rate of 6.3% annually from 2025 to 2027  on  average.

Peak power use reached  a  record  250 GW  in  May,  surpassing  the  previous  high  of  243 GW recorded in September 2023. Total electricity generation increased by 15% y-o-y to  168 TWh  in  May  compared  to  the  same  month  in  2023,  driven  by  an unprecedented  heatwave  that  led  to  a  spike  in  cooling  demand.  According  to India's Ministry of Power, by 2030 peak electricity demand is forecast to exceed 400 GW, with 65% of capacity expected to come from non-fossil fuel sources.\n\nIn February 2023, the Ministry of Power invoked Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003,  which  directed  all  imported  coal-based  power  plants  to  operate  at  full capacity to avoid electricity shortages. This was extended multiple times, and the latest extension mandated that imported coal-based power plants operate at full capacity until the end of February 2025. Section 11 was also used to direct gasfired power stations to operationalise according to government instruction for the months of May and June last year.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: ## Daily peak load in cooling season compared to average temperature in India, 2019-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

In  Rajasthan,  agricultural demand makes up around 40% of the total statewise. In the past, farmers would activate water pumps at night only, as agricultural feeders provided free or cheap electricity at that time. Other farmers rely on diesel-fuelled pumps, which are more expensive to operate and polluting. Until 2019, average load was typically higher in  the  evening  due  to  increased  demand  in  agriculture  and  residential  sectors between 7:00 and 8:00.\n\n## Load profile and renewable generation (excluding large hydro) on yearly peak-load days in India, 2017-2024\n\nNote: Renewable energy generation includes wind, solar, biomass, bagasse, small hydro and other renewables.

More than  half  of  global  electricity  demand  growth  in  2024  came  from  China, where it grew by 7% in 2024, similar to the previous year. Electricity demand in China  is  forecast  to  increase  on  average  by  6%  annually  out  to  2027.  India, Southeast  Asian  countries  and  other  emerging  markets  are  also  expected  to record strong demand growth, supported by economic expansion and rising air conditioner ownership. India's electricity demand is forecast to grow at an average 6.3% annually over the next three years, stronger than the 2015-2024 average growth rate of 5%. While many emerging economies are seeing robust electricity demand growth, Africa is lagging. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa still do not have access to reliable electricity.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: Notes: Other non-renewables includes oil, waste and other non-renewable sources.

Global electricity demand rose by 4.3% in 2024 and is forecast to continue to grow at close to 4% out to 2027. Over the next  three  years,  global  electricity  consumption  is  forecast  to  rise  by  an unprecedented 3 500 TWh.  This corresponds to adding more than the equivalent of a Japan to the world's electricity consumption each year. This is also a sharp acceleration over the 2.5% increase in 2023, when strong gains in China, India and Southeast Asia were tempered by declines in advanced economies.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies, led by China, are the main drivers of electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: Hydropower saw an increase of 2.5% y-o-y, following a large 17% decrease in hydropower generation in 2023.

However, as each region is expected to experience its peak demand at different times,  power  imports  and  exports  between  regions  would  allow  for  some balancing. The country as a whole is expected to have a surplus of only 0.7% to meet the peak electricity demand (estimated at around 230 GW), indicating a tight supply  situation.  In  June  2023,  with  increasing  temperatures,  peak  demand  of 223 GW was already observed. India has installed significant  solar  generation capacities in recent years, which helps meet daytime peak demand for cooling. However, evening peaks when the sun does not shine but temperatures remain very high pose a significant challenge to the system. In such evening hours, the sufficient availability of dispatchable capacities of hydro, coal- and gas-fired power plants becomes crucial. New generation capacity additions in recent years have lagged behind the increase in peak power demand, leading the Ministry of Power in June 2023 to issue guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for electricity to ensure that generation capacity is added at a pace matching growth in demand. A new tariff scheme was also outlined, which introduces varying timeof-day tariffs between solar hours, normal hours and peak hours to incentivise the shifting of demand from the evening to daytime.

This  order  is  expected  to especially affect coal plants that use imported coal and were not operating at full capacity. Solar generation also increased strongly in H1 2023 by 26% compared to  previous  year.  We forecast coal-fired  generation  in  India  for  the  full  year  to increase by 4.2%, and to continue its increase in 2024, albeit at a slower pace of 2.5%, as renewables and nuclear are expected to expand significantly to meet a higher share of the growing electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation by source in selected regions, 2019-2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Although  the  economic  rebound  following  the  easing  of  strict  pandemic restrictions has not been as strong as some had anticipated, increasing cooling demand in the summer of 2023 is expected to further boost electricity demand. For 2024, we forecast demand growth to be slightly lower at 5.1%.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2024\n\nNote: The figures for 2023 and 2024 are forecast values.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn India , the strong post-pandemic recovery, combined with intense heatwaves, drove electricity demand up by 8.4% in 2022. We expect the strong growth trend to continue in 2023, at a rate of 6.8%. Growth of 6.1% is forecast in 2024, by when India's electricity consumption is expected to surpass that of Japan and Korea combined. The rapidly increasing demand in India will continue to be driven by an uptick in household appliances, a rise in electrical machinery usage, an increase in electric vehicles, and further expansion in cooling systems.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States rose by 2.6% in 2022, driven by economic growth as well as increased heating and air conditioning use.

Almost two-thirds of  the  net  reduction  in  EU  electricity  demand  in  2022  is  estimated  to  be  from energy-intensive industries grappling with elevated energy prices. This trend has continued well into 2023, despite the prices for energy commodities and electricity falling from their previous record highs. As policy developments abroad courting industrial  investment  put  pressure  on  Europe's  industrial  competitiveness,  the European  Union  is  at  a  crossroads.  The  outcome  of  policy  discussions  now underway could determine the future of its energy-intensive industrial sector.\n\nThe substantial demand declines in advanced economies contrast sharply with the growth observed in emerging economies such as China and India. Japan is similarly expected to record a significant 3% fall in electricity demand in 2023, while the United States is set to see a decrease of almost 2%. In contrast, China's electricity demand is expected to increase by 5.3% in 2023 and 5.1% in 2024,  slightly  below  its  2015-2019  average  of  5.4%.  India  is  set  to  have  an average annual growth rate of 6.5% over the outlook period, surpassing its 20152019 average of 5.2%.\n\n## Declines in fossil-fired electricity generation are becoming structural\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: ## Evolution of the forecasts for peak load, availability and margin of the Indian Central Electricity Authority vs. the realised and met peak load, 2019-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Nevertheless, as shown in our recent analysis,  additional  demand  from  cooling  remains  substantial,  especially  in Southern Europe and France. In the case of unexpected unavailabilities, electricity imports will  play  a  significant  role  to  meet  demand,  as  also  highlighted  by  the ENTSO-E outlook.\n\n## Supply: Renewable generation set to overtake coal\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: Wholesale  electricity  prices  remain  elevated  in  many  countries  despite substantial declines, although there are regional differences. As prices for energy commodities such as gas and coal have fallen significantly in the first half of  2023,  wholesale  electricity  prices  in  many  regions  have  declined  from  their previous  peaks.  European  wholesale  prices  halved  from  their  record  highs  in 2022, falling closer to their 2021 average. Despite this, average prices in Europe are  still  more  than  double  2019  levels.  Similarly,  average  wholesale  electricity prices in India in the first half of 2023 were still 80% higher than 2019 levels, and in  Japan  they  were  30%  higher  compared  to  2019.  In  contrast,  wholesale electricity prices in the United States have almost fallen back to 2019 levels.\n\n## Impact of weather on electricity demand and supply is increasingly noticeable\n\nRising demand for cooling is straining the world's power systems. Summers with  extreme  temperatures  are  becoming  more  frequent  in  many  regions, elevating electricity demand for cooling systems and stretching power supplies. As more households start purchasing air conditioners, the impact will increase in many countries - especially in emerging economies that currently have a much lower share of households with AC than advanced economies with comparable climates. Setting higher efficiency standards for air conditioning would greatly help limit the impact of additional cooling demand on power systems. To ensure system reliability,  it  will  be  crucial  to  have  adequate  backup  generation  capacities, encourage demand management and energy storage, accelerate grid investments,  and  enhance  fuel  supply  security  for  power  plants.

Demand is expected to grow by slightly less than 2% in 2023, down from a rate of 2.3% in 2022 and the average annual growth rate of 2.4% observed over the 2015-2019 period. This moderation is strongly driven by declining electricity demand in advanced economies, which are dealing with the ongoing effects of the global energy crisis and slower economic growth. In 2024, as  expectations  for  the  economic  outlook  improve,  global  electricity  demand growth is forecast to rebound to 3.3%.\n\nElectricity demand in the European Union is set to decline in 2023 for the second year in a row, falling to its lowest level in two decades. EU electricity demand is expected to record a 3% drop in 2023, after already falling 3% in 2022. This  is  despite  strong  growth  in  electrification  with  a  record  number  of  electric vehicles and heat pumps sold. Following these two consecutive declines, which together amount to the region's largest slump in demand on record, EU electricity demand is set to drop to levels last seen in 2002.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\n- Production curtailment\n- Permanent shutdown\n- Production resumption\n- Wholesale electricity price (3MMA)\n- Production investment abandoned or shifted abroad\n\nIEA.

In contrast, China's electricity demand is expected to increase by 5.3% in 2023 and 5.1% in 2024,  slightly  below  its  2015-2019  average  of  5.4%.  India  is  set  to  have  an average annual growth rate of 6.5% over the outlook period, surpassing its 20152019 average of 5.2%.\n\n## Declines in fossil-fired electricity generation are becoming structural\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The figures for 2023 and 2024 are forecast values.\n\nThe European Union 's electricity consumption decreased by 3.2% in 2022, the second largest drop since the 2009 global financial crisis, exceeded only by 2020's plunge due to Covid-19. The downward trend became apparent in the second half of  2022 and continued well into the first half of 2023. EU electricity demand in H1 2023 fell almost 6% from the same year-ago period. For the full year we expect an overall drop in demand of 3%. With that, EU electricity consumption will have declined for two years in a row at a rate unprecedented since the foundation of the  Union.  We  anticipate  a  modest  1.7% rebound  in  2024,  but  with  significant uncertainty linked to the recovery of industrial demand. The biggest question is how  much  of  the  reduction  in  demand  was  temporary  and  how  much  will  be permanent.\n\n## Is energy-intensive industry leaving Europe?\n\nIn a recent analysis discussing EU electricity demand in 2022, we showed that weather had a more limited effect than previously thought, as the exceptionally mild winter was partly offset by additional cooling needs during the hotter summer. Most of the demand reduction occurred because of non-weather-related factors, with nearly two-thirds of the net decline estimated to be due to the reduction in demand from energy-intensive industries amid high energy prices. Behavioural changes  in  the  residential  and  services  sectors,  voluntary  energy  savings, affordability  issues,  and  a  variety  of  efficiency  improvements  also  played  a significant role.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on data from Load Generation Balance Reports of the Indian Central Electricity Authority and ERCOT\n\nIn India , Central Electricity Authority's Load Generation Balance Report 2023-24, published  in  March  2023,  estimates  that  sub-regions  in  India  may  face  power supply  deficits  ranging  from  4%  to  11.3%  of  their  respective  peak  demand. However, as each region is expected to experience its peak demand at different times,  power  imports  and  exports  between  regions  would  allow  for  some balancing. The country as a whole is expected to have a surplus of only 0.7% to meet the peak electricity demand (estimated at around 230 GW), indicating a tight supply  situation.  In  June  2023,  with  increasing  temperatures,  peak  demand  of 223 GW was already observed. India has installed significant  solar  generation capacities in recent years, which helps meet daytime peak demand for cooling. However, evening peaks when the sun does not shine but temperatures remain very high pose a significant challenge to the system. In such evening hours, the sufficient availability of dispatchable capacities of hydro, coal- and gas-fired power plants becomes crucial. New generation capacity additions in recent years have lagged behind the increase in peak power demand, leading the Ministry of Power in June 2023 to issue guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for electricity to ensure that generation capacity is added at a pace matching growth in demand. A new tariff scheme was also outlined, which introduces varying timeof-day tariffs between solar hours, normal hours and peak hours to incentivise the shifting of demand from the evening to daytime. The new tariffs are to come into effect during 2024 and 2025.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: ## Demand: Global electricity demand growth expected to ease in 2023\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing global energy crisis ignited inflation and stifled economic growth in many parts of the world, as spiking gas and coal prices raised the cost of power generation and drove up electricity bills. Despite these headwinds, global electricity demand remained resilient in 2022, growing by 2.3%. The impacts of the crisis continued into 2023, with economic slowdowns observed  in  various  regions  and  particularly  pronounced  declines  in  electricity demand in advanced economies. As a result, despite robust growth in emerging economies as well as record electric vehicle and heat pump sales leading to rising electrification  rates  in  the  transport  and  residential  sectors,  global  electricity demand growth is expected to be subdued in 2023. Our previous growth forecast of  2.6%  has  been  revised  downward  to  1.9%,  which  is  slower  than  the  2.4% average annual growth over the 2015-2019 period. We forecast global electricity demand will grow at a higher 3.3% rate in 2024 as the economic outlook improves.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Robust growth in electricity demand in China and India, declines in the USA and the EU\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: ## The business case for energy arbitrage is becoming more attractive\n\n## Average daily standard deviation and share of variable renewable energy in total electricity generation in selected regions, 2019-2023H1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage daily standard deviation (left axis) Share of VRE in total generation (right axis)\n\nIEA.

For  example,  in  Australia, large-scale battery energy storage saw record high revenue in 2022. The average daily standard deviation of prices represents the daily volatility and can be used as  a  good  proxy  to  compare  energy  arbitrage  potential,  especially  for  storage systems with shorter charging and discharging cycles such as battery systems. For example, average daily standard deviation on the hourly day-ahead market\n\nincreased  in  the  Netherlands  from  about  EUR 9/MWh  in  2017  to  a  massive EUR 61/MWh in 2022, then falling to EUR 32/MWh in H1 2023. The large increase after 2020 is due to soaring gas prices, as gas is often the marginal generation source  that  sets  electricity  prices.  The  growing  share  of  renewables  was  a contributor to the number of hours with lower prices.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2024'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2024'}, log="Year: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: (2.9 Wh per request), and considering 9 billion searches daily, this would require almost 10 TWh of additional electricity in a year.\n\nAI electricity demand can be forecast more comprehensively based on the amount of AI servers that are estimated to be sold in the future and their rated power. The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually. By 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023.\n\n## Estimated electricity demand from traditional data centres, dedicated AI data centres and cryptocurrencies, 2022 and 2026, base case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity  demand in India rose  by  7%  in  2023  compared to last year's 8.6%. Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Smart meters not only enable better and more detailed data collection, which can be used for an improved assessment of self-consumption, among other things, but can also enable considerable cost savings. For example, in 2018 alone, with an installation cost of EUR 180-200, smart meters in the European Union have reportedly  allowed  yearly  savings  of  EUR 280 per  metering  point  on  average among the member states, which are based on direct and indirect benefits for consumers.  Direct  consumer  benefits  derive  from  an  observed  behavioural change in energy consumption triggered by the awareness of the granular data from smart meters. Additionally, timely information about dynamic tariffs motivates consumers to shift their energy consumption to times when is most economically convenient.  Indirect  benefits  are  enabled  by  an  improvement  on  the  utility's operations, for example, by remote management of the metering system.\n\n## Supply: Clean electricity to meet all additional demand out to 2026\n\n## Renewables overtake coal as the largest source of global electricity supply in 2025\n\nOur forecast period out to 2026 is characterised by three turning points with regard to low-carbon electricity sources. First, renewables are expected to generate more than one-third of world's electricity in 2025, overtaking coal as the largest source of supply. Second, low-carbon sources - renewables and nuclear together - are expected to account for 46% of the world's electricity generation by the end of 2026, rapidly approaching the halfway mark, up from 39% in 2023. And finally, on a global scale, low-carbon generation is set to meet all the additional demand growth towards 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union, data centre electricity consumption is estimated at slightly below 100 TWh in 2022, almost 4% of total EU electricity demand. Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Year-on-year percent change in global electricity demand, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs in 2023, China and India are on track to post robust increases in electricity demand in 2024, driven by economic growth and rising cooling needs. The United States is also set to see significant demand growth, boosted by stronger economic activity, following a decline in 2023 driven by mild weather. After two consecutive years of decline, the European Union's demand is recovering, albeit at a moderate pace, as various energy-intensive industries ramp-up operations. The sustained increases in  electricity  consumption  in  these  regions  amid  rising  electrification, combined with robust growth in other emerging economies, is expected to support global electricity demand in 2025 at a similar rate of 4%.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electricity demand in China propelled higher by a rapid rise in EV and solar PV production\n\nFollowing a strong 7% y-o-y increase in electricity consumption in 2023, growth in continued at an estimated rate of around 6.5% in H1 2024. For full year, demand growth of 6.5% is forecast, before moderately easing to 6.2% in 2025.\n\nChina Despite  the  expected  slowdown  in  the  Chinese  economy  and  the  continuing structural shift to towards becoming less reliant on heavy industries, the rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules, electric vehicles, batteries, and the processing of related materials are all supporting electricity demand growth. Data centres and 5G networks with increasing digitalisation are other important drivers. Over  the  last  three  years,  China  has  been  adding  on  average  roughly  one Germany each year in terms of electricity demand and this trend is expected to continue through 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log="Year: 2025\nContent: ## Data centres are a key driver of electricity demand growth in the United States\n\nThe rapid expansion of data centres in the United States has positioned the sector as a major catalyst of electricity demand growth, which will have a substantial impact on the country's energy landscape. A recent study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy highlights the strong growth in electricity consumption by data centres, which rose from about 60 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023, and constituted more than 4% of the country's total electricity  use.  Their  scenarios indicate  this  consumption  could  rise  by  an  additional  150 TWh  to  400 TWh  by 2028, reaching about 325 TWh to 580 TWh, and accounting for 6.7% to 12% of total US electricity demand. The growth trend is supported by the record pace of new data centre announcements. In the first half of 2024 alone, announced data centre projects were associated with nearly 24 GW of power capacity needs triple the amount stated during the same period in 2023.\n\n## Estimated drivers of change in electricity demand in the United States, 2024 vs. 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

This change in the GDP and electricity demand  dynamic  in  advanced  economies  reflects  a  combination  of  increased\n\nefficiency  gains  across  all  end-use  sectors,  most  notably  in  LED  lighting  and appliances as well as heavy industries moving abroad to developing economies over the past several decades. Now, once again, we expect electricity demand in advanced economies to start rising alongside economic growth, in a reversal of the  trend  over  the  past  15  years.  This  is  driven  by  a  combination  of  rising consumption from electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps.\n\n## Evolution of per capita electricity consumption and GDP in selected regions throughout the years, 1990-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Many advanced economies - such as Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea and the United States - are expected to see electricity consumption rise through 2027 following increases in 2024. In advanced economies, electricity demand - both in total and per capita - has stayed relatively flat or even declined since  2009  even  as  the  economies  themselves  have  continued  to  grow.  This dynamic in advanced economies reflected a combination of increased efficiency gains across all end-use sectors, most notably in lighting and appliances, as well as  the  restructuring  and  relocation  of  heavy  industries  over  the  past  several decades.  Now,  once  again,  electricity  demand  in  advanced  economies  is expected to start rising significantly alongside economic growth, bucking the trend of the past 15 years. This is driven by higher consumption from the deployment of electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps, among other enduse technologies.\n\nIn the United States, the world's second-largest electricity consumer after China, demand rebounded in 2024, growing by 2% to reach a new high. This followed a 1.8% decline in 2023 due to mild weather and weaker manufacturing activity. We expect US electricity demand to grow at an average annual rate of 2%\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: While some studies clearly indicate whether they include or exclude data networks in their estimates, many of the published estimates are not clear on their scope of analysis  or  other  methodological  details.  Based  on  our  analysis  of  published company-level disclosures on energy use, it appears likely that many studies also include  the  electricity consumption  of  networks  in  their  energy  estimates. Therefore, in order to identify trends for data centres correctly, it is important to separately understand the electricity consumption trends of networks.\n\nBased on the electricity use data published by China's largest telecommunication operators, including China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, we estimate that telecommunication networks in China consumed 90-110 TWh in 2023, with our central estimate being 100 TWh 3 . This total includes mobile networks (3G, 4G, and 5G) as well as fixed access and core networks. We estimate 5G networks consumed around 30 TWh and 3G/4G around 35 TWh in 2023 4 , with the rest from fixed and core networks.\n\n## Electricity demand projections for the data centre sector in China from multiple sources, possibly including telecommunication networks, 2015-2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

These are plotted in dashed lines.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: Over the period 2025-2027, we estimate that electricity consumption will grow on average by 3.3% per year. Gas-fired electricity generation is expected to decline by around 1% annually in 2025-2027, whereas renewables will continue to see strong growth of 12% over the outlook period. We anticipate solar PV and wind power generation to be the primary drivers of increased renewables, averaging growth of 32% and 12%, respectively.\n\nData  centres  in  Ireland  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  6.3 TWh  in  2023, according  to  the  Central  Statistics  Office,  an  increase  of  20%  over  2022. Accordingly, data centres accounted for about 20% of total electricity consumption in 2023, more than the 18% of total electricity consumption by urban households. Data centres are scrutinised closely at the planning stage, with some applications rejected due to concerns such as how their operation would affect the grid.\n\nAdditional  investment  of  EUR 750 million  was  injected  into the  development  of electricity  grid  infrastructure,  particularly  for  offshore  grid  development.  One aspect of back-up to the grid will be provided by the Moneypoint 900 MW power\n\nstation.  This  was  originally  a  coal-fired  power station  but  is  being  converted  to heavy fuel oil where it will operate as a generator of last resort until 2029.

According to the Special Action Plan for Green and Low-Carbon Development  of  Data  Centres  (2024),  China  has  set  objectives  to  reduce  the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) 7  of data centres to below 1.5, improve the average Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) and to increase the overall on-load rate to no less than 60% by the end of 2025. Similarly, the 2024 Action Plan included goals to increase the share of clean energy  in  data  centres'  electricity  consumption,  setting  targets  for  the  overall utilisation rate of renewable energy to increase by 10% annually for data centres and for EDWC data centres to source at least 80% of their electricity consumption from renewables by 2025.\n\n## Strong growth in peak electricity load in India amid economic growth and rising AC usage\n\nFollowing a strong 8.3% increase in 2023, electricity demand in India grew 5.8% y-o-y in 2024 amid strong economic growth. While electricity consumption rose by a robust 8.5% during the first half of the year due to intense and long heatwaves, the  second  half  saw  a  more  subdued  growth  in  demand  amid milder  weather. Supported  by  rapid  economic  expansion  and  increasing  electrification,  India's electricity demand is forecast to grow at a high rate of 6.3% annually from 2025 to 2027  on  average.  Rising  air  conditioner  ownership  will  continue  to  bolster electricity demand growth.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

GDP growth is based on the October 2024 edition of the IMF World Economic Outlook.\n\nWhat is clear is that from 2020 onward Chinese electricity demand growth has outpaced GDP due to a convergence of factors that paved the way for increased electrification  in  the  country.  Our  analysis  shows  that  the  rapid  electrification across all sectors has had a major transformative impact of increasing electricity demand  beyond  economic  growth.  The  share  of  electricity in total final consumption in China is estimated at 28% in 2024, up from 27% in 2023. The share of electricity in total final consumption is currently estimated at 22% in the United States and 21% in the European Union.\n\nIn sectors outside of industry, important catalysts of higher electricity consumption include the growing stock of air conditioners, expansion of data centres and 5G, and  stronger  EV  charging  demand.  In  the  industry  sector,  alongside  rising electrification, the sharp increase in electricity-intensive production of new energy\n\nproducts such as PV modules, batteries and EVs has been a major source of growth  in  recent  years.  While  overall  GDP  is  following  its  2008-2020  trend, industrial electricity demand growth has been higher than the economy's pace of expansion. As a result, even though the economy is slowing down in aggregate, total  electricity  demand growth remains robust as the country overall becomes more electricity-intensive.\n\n## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

With an analysis based on FERC Form 714 filings of the planning areas,  the  study  shows  that  the  aggregate  electricity  consumption  forecast  for 2029  has  been  moving  upwards  since  2023.  The  aggregate  net  electricity consumption forecast in 2022 for 2029 was 4 375 TWh. In 2023, this figure was revised upwards significantly, to 4 553 TWh, and in 2024 even more sharply to 4 773 TWh. Assuming the realised net electricity demand for 2024 of 4 090 TWh\n\nas  the  baseline,  this  corresponds  to  average  annual  growth  of  1.4%  for  the 2025-2029 period for the aggregate submissions in 2022, and upward revised values of 2.2% for submissions in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. 11\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: ## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

Over the threeyear period from 2022 to 2024, 48% of the increase in Chinese electricity demand came from the industry sector. The manufacturing of PV modules, batteries, and EVs  excluding  the  processing  of  associated  materials  are  estimated  to  have consumed around 320 TWh of electricity in 2024 - as much electricity as Italy uses in a year. The increase in consumption of these sectors has been remarkable in recent  years,  which  rose  by  more  than  230  TWh  over  2022-2024.  During  this period, new energy products made up nearly 35% of the increase in industrial electricity  demand and 16% of the growth in total electricity use across China. Including the numerous electricity-intensive upstream processes associated with these products that take place in China, such as the refining and processing of the related materials, can further boost these numbers.\n\nOver 2025-2027, we expect the industry sector to make up roughly 50% of the additional demand growth.

Egypt saw an increase in the yearly rate of demand growth to 1.6% and Algeria continued the trend of strong growth of recent years with a rise of 5.4%. These three countries combined consume over half of all electricity in Africa. We expect this trend of rising electricity demand throughout much of the continent to  continue  over  the  2025-2027  period,  averaging  approximately  5%  per  year. Nevertheless,  electricity  consumption  growth  is  hampered,  especially  in  subSaharan Africa, due to lack of supply.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand, Africa, 2020-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

EU electricity demand is expected to record a 3% drop in 2023, after already falling 3% in 2022. This  is  despite  strong  growth  in  electrification  with  a  record  number  of  electric vehicles and heat pumps sold.

As  more  batteries  provide  these  services, frequency  control  markets  would  start  to  get  saturated,  limiting  the  potential profitability for additional batteries in this market segment. With increasing volatility on the spot markets, energy arbitrage can therefore provide an improved business case  when  stacked  with  other  revenue  sources  such  as  ancillary  services provision.  Intraday  markets,  with  their  significantly  higher  volatility  and  profit potential, are expected to become increasingly important for storage systems.\n\n## General annex\n\n## Summary tables\n\n## Regional breakdown of electricity demand, 2021-2024\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: Europe's energy-intensive industries have not yet recovered from last year's production slump, as evidenced by the staggering 6% year-on-year decline in total EU electricity demand during the first half of 2023. Almost two-thirds of  the  net  reduction  in  EU  electricity  demand  in  2022  is  estimated  to  be  from energy-intensive industries grappling with elevated energy prices. This trend has continued well into 2023, despite the prices for energy commodities and electricity falling from their previous record highs. As policy developments abroad courting industrial  investment  put  pressure  on  Europe's  industrial  competitiveness,  the European  Union  is  at  a  crossroads.  The  outcome  of  policy  discussions  now underway could determine the future of its energy-intensive industrial sector.\n\nThe substantial demand declines in advanced economies contrast sharply with the growth observed in emerging economies such as China and India. Japan is similarly expected to record a significant 3% fall in electricity demand in 2023, while the United States is set to see a decrease of almost 2%. In contrast, China's electricity demand is expected to increase by 5.3% in 2023 and 5.1% in 2024,  slightly  below  its  2015-2019  average  of  5.4%.  India  is  set  to  have  an average annual growth rate of 6.5% over the outlook period, surpassing its 20152019 average of 5.2%.\n\n## Declines in fossil-fired electricity generation are becoming structural\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The figures for 2023 and 2024 are forecast values.\n\nThe European Union 's electricity consumption decreased by 3.2% in 2022, the second largest drop since the 2009 global financial crisis, exceeded only by 2020's plunge due to Covid-19. The downward trend became apparent in the second half of  2022 and continued well into the first half of 2023. EU electricity demand in H1 2023 fell almost 6% from the same year-ago period. For the full year we expect an overall drop in demand of 3%. With that, EU electricity consumption will have declined for two years in a row at a rate unprecedented since the foundation of the  Union.  We  anticipate  a  modest  1.7% rebound  in  2024,  but  with  significant uncertainty linked to the recovery of industrial demand. The biggest question is how  much  of  the  reduction  in  demand  was  temporary  and  how  much  will  be permanent.\n\n## Is energy-intensive industry leaving Europe?\n\nIn a recent analysis discussing EU electricity demand in 2022, we showed that weather had a more limited effect than previously thought, as the exceptionally mild winter was partly offset by additional cooling needs during the hotter summer. Most of the demand reduction occurred because of non-weather-related factors, with nearly two-thirds of the net decline estimated to be due to the reduction in demand from energy-intensive industries amid high energy prices. Behavioural changes  in  the  residential  and  services  sectors,  voluntary  energy  savings, affordability  issues,  and  a  variety  of  efficiency  improvements  also  played  a significant role.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on data from Load Generation Balance Reports of the Indian Central Electricity Authority and ERCOT\n\nIn India , Central Electricity Authority's Load Generation Balance Report 2023-24, published  in  March  2023,  estimates  that  sub-regions  in  India  may  face  power supply  deficits  ranging  from  4%  to  11.3%  of  their  respective  peak  demand. However, as each region is expected to experience its peak demand at different times,  power  imports  and  exports  between  regions  would  allow  for  some balancing. The country as a whole is expected to have a surplus of only 0.7% to meet the peak electricity demand (estimated at around 230 GW), indicating a tight supply  situation.  In  June  2023,  with  increasing  temperatures,  peak  demand  of 223 GW was already observed. India has installed significant  solar  generation capacities in recent years, which helps meet daytime peak demand for cooling. However, evening peaks when the sun does not shine but temperatures remain very high pose a significant challenge to the system. In such evening hours, the sufficient availability of dispatchable capacities of hydro, coal- and gas-fired power plants becomes crucial. New generation capacity additions in recent years have lagged behind the increase in peak power demand, leading the Ministry of Power in June 2023 to issue guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for electricity to ensure that generation capacity is added at a pace matching growth in demand. A new tariff scheme was also outlined, which introduces varying timeof-day tariffs between solar hours, normal hours and peak hours to incentivise the shifting of demand from the evening to daytime. The new tariffs are to come into effect during 2024 and 2025.\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: ## Demand: Global electricity demand growth expected to ease in 2023\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing global energy crisis ignited inflation and stifled economic growth in many parts of the world, as spiking gas and coal prices raised the cost of power generation and drove up electricity bills. Despite these headwinds, global electricity demand remained resilient in 2022, growing by 2.3%. The impacts of the crisis continued into 2023, with economic slowdowns observed  in  various  regions  and  particularly  pronounced  declines  in  electricity demand in advanced economies. As a result, despite robust growth in emerging economies as well as record electric vehicle and heat pump sales leading to rising electrification  rates  in  the  transport  and  residential  sectors,  global  electricity demand growth is expected to be subdued in 2023. Our previous growth forecast of  2.6%  has  been  revised  downward  to  1.9%,  which  is  slower  than  the  2.4% average annual growth over the 2015-2019 period. We forecast global electricity demand will grow at a higher 3.3% rate in 2024 as the economic outlook improves.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Robust growth in electricity demand in China and India, declines in the USA and the EU\n\n---\nYear: market-report-update-2023\nContent: ## The business case for energy arbitrage is becoming more attractive\n\n## Average daily standard deviation and share of variable renewable energy in total electricity generation in selected regions, 2019-2023H1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage daily standard deviation (left axis) Share of VRE in total generation (right axis)\n\nIEA.

For  example,  in  Australia, large-scale battery energy storage saw record high revenue in 2022. The average daily standard deviation of prices represents the daily volatility and can be used as  a  good  proxy  to  compare  energy  arbitrage  potential,  especially  for  storage systems with shorter charging and discharging cycles such as battery systems. For example, average daily standard deviation on the hourly day-ahead market\n\nincreased  in  the  Netherlands  from  about  EUR 9/MWh  in  2017  to  a  massive EUR 61/MWh in 2022, then falling to EUR 32/MWh in H1 2023. The large increase after 2020 is due to soaring gas prices, as gas is often the marginal generation source  that  sets  electricity  prices.  The  growing  share  of  renewables  was  a contributor to the number of hours with lower prices.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2024'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2024'}, log="Year: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: (2.9 Wh per request), and considering 9 billion searches daily, this would require almost 10 TWh of additional electricity in a year.\n\nAI electricity demand can be forecast more comprehensively based on the amount of AI servers that are estimated to be sold in the future and their rated power. The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually. By 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023.\n\n## Estimated electricity demand from traditional data centres, dedicated AI data centres and cryptocurrencies, 2022 and 2026, base case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity  demand in India rose  by  7%  in  2023  compared to last year's 8.6%. Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Smart meters not only enable better and more detailed data collection, which can be used for an improved assessment of self-consumption, among other things, but can also enable considerable cost savings. For example, in 2018 alone, with an installation cost of EUR 180-200, smart meters in the European Union have reportedly  allowed  yearly  savings  of  EUR 280 per  metering  point  on  average among the member states, which are based on direct and indirect benefits for consumers.  Direct  consumer  benefits  derive  from  an  observed  behavioural change in energy consumption triggered by the awareness of the granular data from smart meters. Additionally, timely information about dynamic tariffs motivates consumers to shift their energy consumption to times when is most economically convenient.  Indirect  benefits  are  enabled  by  an  improvement  on  the  utility's operations, for example, by remote management of the metering system.\n\n## Supply: Clean electricity to meet all additional demand out to 2026\n\n## Renewables overtake coal as the largest source of global electricity supply in 2025\n\nOur forecast period out to 2026 is characterised by three turning points with regard to low-carbon electricity sources. First, renewables are expected to generate more than one-third of world's electricity in 2025, overtaking coal as the largest source of supply. Second, low-carbon sources - renewables and nuclear together - are expected to account for 46% of the world's electricity generation by the end of 2026, rapidly approaching the halfway mark, up from 39% in 2023. And finally, on a global scale, low-carbon generation is set to meet all the additional demand growth towards 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union, data centre electricity consumption is estimated at slightly below 100 TWh in 2022, almost 4% of total EU electricity demand. Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Year-on-year percent change in global electricity demand, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs in 2023, China and India are on track to post robust increases in electricity demand in 2024, driven by economic growth and rising cooling needs. The United States is also set to see significant demand growth, boosted by stronger economic activity, following a decline in 2023 driven by mild weather. After two consecutive years of decline, the European Union's demand is recovering, albeit at a moderate pace, as various energy-intensive industries ramp-up operations. The sustained increases in  electricity  consumption  in  these  regions  amid  rising  electrification, combined with robust growth in other emerging economies, is expected to support global electricity demand in 2025 at a similar rate of 4%.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electricity demand in China propelled higher by a rapid rise in EV and solar PV production\n\nFollowing a strong 7% y-o-y increase in electricity consumption in 2023, growth in continued at an estimated rate of around 6.5% in H1 2024. For full year, demand growth of 6.5% is forecast, before moderately easing to 6.2% in 2025.\n\nChina Despite  the  expected  slowdown  in  the  Chinese  economy  and  the  continuing structural shift to towards becoming less reliant on heavy industries, the rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules, electric vehicles, batteries, and the processing of related materials are all supporting electricity demand growth. Data centres and 5G networks with increasing digitalisation are other important drivers. Over  the  last  three  years,  China  has  been  adding  on  average  roughly  one Germany each year in terms of electricity demand and this trend is expected to continue through 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log="Year: 2025\nContent: ## Data centres are a key driver of electricity demand growth in the United States\n\nThe rapid expansion of data centres in the United States has positioned the sector as a major catalyst of electricity demand growth, which will have a substantial impact on the country's energy landscape. A recent study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy highlights the strong growth in electricity consumption by data centres, which rose from about 60 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023, and constituted more than 4% of the country's total electricity  use.  Their  scenarios indicate  this  consumption  could  rise  by  an  additional  150 TWh  to  400 TWh  by 2028, reaching about 325 TWh to 580 TWh, and accounting for 6.7% to 12% of total US electricity demand. The growth trend is supported by the record pace of new data centre announcements. In the first half of 2024 alone, announced data centre projects were associated with nearly 24 GW of power capacity needs triple the amount stated during the same period in 2023.\n\n## Estimated drivers of change in electricity demand in the United States, 2024 vs. 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

This change in the GDP and electricity demand  dynamic  in  advanced  economies  reflects  a  combination  of  increased\n\nefficiency  gains  across  all  end-use  sectors,  most  notably  in  LED  lighting  and appliances as well as heavy industries moving abroad to developing economies over the past several decades. Now, once again, we expect electricity demand in advanced economies to start rising alongside economic growth, in a reversal of the  trend  over  the  past  15  years.  This  is  driven  by  a  combination  of  rising consumption from electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps.\n\n## Evolution of per capita electricity consumption and GDP in selected regions throughout the years, 1990-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Many advanced economies - such as Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea and the United States - are expected to see electricity consumption rise through 2027 following increases in 2024. In advanced economies, electricity demand - both in total and per capita - has stayed relatively flat or even declined since  2009  even  as  the  economies  themselves  have  continued  to  grow.  This dynamic in advanced economies reflected a combination of increased efficiency gains across all end-use sectors, most notably in lighting and appliances, as well as  the  restructuring  and  relocation  of  heavy  industries  over  the  past  several decades.  Now,  once  again,  electricity  demand  in  advanced  economies  is expected to start rising significantly alongside economic growth, bucking the trend of the past 15 years. This is driven by higher consumption from the deployment of electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps, among other enduse technologies.\n\nIn the United States, the world's second-largest electricity consumer after China, demand rebounded in 2024, growing by 2% to reach a new high. This followed a 1.8% decline in 2023 due to mild weather and weaker manufacturing activity. We expect US electricity demand to grow at an average annual rate of 2%\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: While some studies clearly indicate whether they include or exclude data networks in their estimates, many of the published estimates are not clear on their scope of analysis  or  other  methodological  details.  Based  on  our  analysis  of  published company-level disclosures on energy use, it appears likely that many studies also include  the  electricity consumption  of  networks  in  their  energy  estimates. Therefore, in order to identify trends for data centres correctly, it is important to separately understand the electricity consumption trends of networks.\n\nBased on the electricity use data published by China's largest telecommunication operators, including China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, we estimate that telecommunication networks in China consumed 90-110 TWh in 2023, with our central estimate being 100 TWh 3 . This total includes mobile networks (3G, 4G, and 5G) as well as fixed access and core networks. We estimate 5G networks consumed around 30 TWh and 3G/4G around 35 TWh in 2023 4 , with the rest from fixed and core networks.\n\n## Electricity demand projections for the data centre sector in China from multiple sources, possibly including telecommunication networks, 2015-2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

These are plotted in dashed lines.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: Over the period 2025-2027, we estimate that electricity consumption will grow on average by 3.3% per year. Gas-fired electricity generation is expected to decline by around 1% annually in 2025-2027, whereas renewables will continue to see strong growth of 12% over the outlook period. We anticipate solar PV and wind power generation to be the primary drivers of increased renewables, averaging growth of 32% and 12%, respectively.\n\nData  centres  in  Ireland  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  6.3 TWh  in  2023, according  to  the  Central  Statistics  Office,  an  increase  of  20%  over  2022. Accordingly, data centres accounted for about 20% of total electricity consumption in 2023, more than the 18% of total electricity consumption by urban households. Data centres are scrutinised closely at the planning stage, with some applications rejected due to concerns such as how their operation would affect the grid.\n\nAdditional  investment  of  EUR 750 million  was  injected  into the  development  of electricity  grid  infrastructure,  particularly  for  offshore  grid  development.  One aspect of back-up to the grid will be provided by the Moneypoint 900 MW power\n\nstation.  This  was  originally  a  coal-fired  power station  but  is  being  converted  to heavy fuel oil where it will operate as a generator of last resort until 2029. The 700 MW  Celtic  Interconnector  project,  which  will  allow  electricity  exchange between  France  and  Ireland,  is  under  construction  and  scheduled  to  become operational in 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: China aims to not only achieve growth in computing power but also efficiency improvements. According to the Special Action Plan for Green and Low-Carbon Development  of  Data  Centres  (2024),  China  has  set  objectives  to  reduce  the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) 7  of data centres to below 1.5, improve the average Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) and to increase the overall on-load rate to no less than 60% by the end of 2025. Similarly, the 2024 Action Plan included goals to increase the share of clean energy  in  data  centres'  electricity  consumption,  setting  targets  for  the  overall utilisation rate of renewable energy to increase by 10% annually for data centres and for EDWC data centres to source at least 80% of their electricity consumption from renewables by 2025.\n\n## Strong growth in peak electricity load in India amid economic growth and rising AC usage\n\nFollowing a strong 8.3% increase in 2023, electricity demand in India grew 5.8% y-o-y in 2024 amid strong economic growth. While electricity consumption rose by a robust 8.5% during the first half of the year due to intense and long heatwaves, the  second  half  saw  a  more  subdued  growth  in  demand  amid milder  weather. Supported  by  rapid  economic  expansion  and  increasing  electrification,  India's electricity demand is forecast to grow at a high rate of 6.3% annually from 2025 to 2027  on  average.

Our  analysis  shows  that  the  rapid  electrification across all sectors has had a major transformative impact of increasing electricity demand  beyond  economic  growth.  The  share  of  electricity in total final consumption in China is estimated at 28% in 2024, up from 27% in 2023. The share of electricity in total final consumption is currently estimated at 22% in the United States and 21% in the European Union.\n\nIn sectors outside of industry, important catalysts of higher electricity consumption include the growing stock of air conditioners, expansion of data centres and 5G, and  stronger  EV  charging  demand.  In  the  industry  sector,  alongside  rising electrification, the sharp increase in electricity-intensive production of new energy\n\nproducts such as PV modules, batteries and EVs has been a major source of growth  in  recent  years.  While  overall  GDP  is  following  its  2008-2020  trend, industrial electricity demand growth has been higher than the economy's pace of expansion. As a result, even though the economy is slowing down in aggregate, total  electricity  demand growth remains robust as the country overall becomes more electricity-intensive.\n\n## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

With an analysis based on FERC Form 714 filings of the planning areas,  the  study  shows  that  the  aggregate  electricity  consumption  forecast  for 2029  has  been  moving  upwards  since  2023.  The  aggregate  net  electricity consumption forecast in 2022 for 2029 was 4 375 TWh. In 2023, this figure was revised upwards significantly, to 4 553 TWh, and in 2024 even more sharply to 4 773 TWh. Assuming the realised net electricity demand for 2024 of 4 090 TWh\n\nas  the  baseline,  this  corresponds  to  average  annual  growth  of  1.4%  for  the 2025-2029 period for the aggregate submissions in 2022, and upward revised values of 2.2% for submissions in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. 11\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: ## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

Over the threeyear period from 2022 to 2024, 48% of the increase in Chinese electricity demand came from the industry sector. The manufacturing of PV modules, batteries, and EVs  excluding  the  processing  of  associated  materials  are  estimated  to  have consumed around 320 TWh of electricity in 2024 - as much electricity as Italy uses in a year. The increase in consumption of these sectors has been remarkable in recent  years,  which  rose  by  more  than  230  TWh  over  2022-2024.  During  this period, new energy products made up nearly 35% of the increase in industrial electricity  demand and 16% of the growth in total electricity use across China. Including the numerous electricity-intensive upstream processes associated with these products that take place in China, such as the refining and processing of the related materials, can further boost these numbers.\n\nOver 2025-2027, we expect the industry sector to make up roughly 50% of the additional demand growth.

The share of gas in the power mix remains steady  at  just  over  70%  throughout  the  forecast,  while  the  contribution  of renewables increases from 16% to 23% between 2024 and 2027.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Africa\n\n## Electricity consumption growth is hampered by insufficient generation capacity\n\nElectricity demand in Africa grew by an estimated 3.4% in 2024, up from just under 2% in 2023. South Africa bounced back from a contraction in demand in 2023 to growth of 4.1% as new capacity was brought online and the power sector limited load shedding. Egypt saw an increase in the yearly rate of demand growth to 1.6% and Algeria continued the trend of strong growth of recent years with a rise of 5.4%. These three countries combined consume over half of all electricity in Africa. We expect this trend of rising electricity demand throughout much of the continent to  continue  over  the  2025-2027  period,  averaging  approximately  5%  per  year. Nevertheless,  electricity  consumption  growth  is  hampered,  especially  in  subSaharan Africa, due to lack of supply.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand, Africa, 2020-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: (2.9 Wh per request), and considering 9 billion searches daily, this would require almost 10 TWh of additional electricity in a year.\n\nAI electricity demand can be forecast more comprehensively based on the amount of AI servers that are estimated to be sold in the future and their rated power. The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually. By 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023.\n\n## Estimated electricity demand from traditional data centres, dedicated AI data centres and cryptocurrencies, 2022 and 2026, base case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Smart meters not only enable better and more detailed data collection, which can be used for an improved assessment of self-consumption, among other things, but can also enable considerable cost savings. For example, in 2018 alone, with an installation cost of EUR 180-200, smart meters in the European Union have reportedly  allowed  yearly  savings  of  EUR 280 per  metering  point  on  average among the member states, which are based on direct and indirect benefits for consumers.  Direct  consumer  benefits  derive  from  an  observed  behavioural change in energy consumption triggered by the awareness of the granular data from smart meters. Additionally, timely information about dynamic tariffs motivates consumers to shift their energy consumption to times when is most economically convenient.  Indirect  benefits  are  enabled  by  an  improvement  on  the  utility's operations, for example, by remote management of the metering system.\n\n## Supply: Clean electricity to meet all additional demand out to 2026\n\n## Renewables overtake coal as the largest source of global electricity supply in 2025\n\nOur forecast period out to 2026 is characterised by three turning points with regard to low-carbon electricity sources. First, renewables are expected to generate more than one-third of world's electricity in 2025, overtaking coal as the largest source of supply. Second, low-carbon sources - renewables and nuclear together - are expected to account for 46% of the world's electricity generation by the end of 2026, rapidly approaching the halfway mark, up from 39% in 2023. And finally, on a global scale, low-carbon generation is set to meet all the additional demand growth towards 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union, data centre electricity consumption is estimated at slightly below 100 TWh in 2022, almost 4% of total EU electricity demand. Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Year-on-year percent change in global electricity demand, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs in 2023, China and India are on track to post robust increases in electricity demand in 2024, driven by economic growth and rising cooling needs. The United States is also set to see significant demand growth, boosted by stronger economic activity, following a decline in 2023 driven by mild weather. After two consecutive years of decline, the European Union's demand is recovering, albeit at a moderate pace, as various energy-intensive industries ramp-up operations. The sustained increases in  electricity  consumption  in  these  regions  amid  rising  electrification, combined with robust growth in other emerging economies, is expected to support global electricity demand in 2025 at a similar rate of 4%.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electricity demand in China propelled higher by a rapid rise in EV and solar PV production\n\nFollowing a strong 7% y-o-y increase in electricity consumption in 2023, growth in continued at an estimated rate of around 6.5% in H1 2024. For full year, demand growth of 6.5% is forecast, before moderately easing to 6.2% in 2025.\n\nChina Despite  the  expected  slowdown  in  the  Chinese  economy  and  the  continuing structural shift to towards becoming less reliant on heavy industries, the rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules, electric vehicles, batteries, and the processing of related materials are all supporting electricity demand growth. Data centres and 5G networks with increasing digitalisation are other important drivers. Over  the  last  three  years,  China  has  been  adding  on  average  roughly  one Germany each year in terms of electricity demand and this trend is expected to continue through 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n"), AgentAction(tool='final_answer', tool_input={'introduction': 'This report provides a comprehensive overview of electricity consumption trends and projections for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Following a 7% increase in India's electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years,  India will add  electricity demand  roughly  equivalent  to  the  current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of  this  demand  growth,  one-third  is  expected  to  come  from  rising  coal-fired generation.  We  also  expect  Southeast  Asia  to  see  robust  annual  increases  in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## Electricity demand in selected regions, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn India , following robust growth over 8% in 2023, the strong economy, expanding industrial  activity  and  intense  heatwaves  combined to boost electricity demand growth  by  8.5%  y-o-y  in  the  first  half  of  2024.  We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. Indian per capita electricity consumption is currently 20% of that in the European  Union.  Along  with  strong  economic  activity,  purchasing  of  new appliances and air conditioning units will continue to support electricity demand.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The figures for 2024 and 2025 are forecast values.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Electricity demand in China is forecast to increase by 6.5% in 2024, similar to  its  average  rate  between  2016  and  2019. This  still  strong  annual  growth represents a modest slowdown from 7% in 2023 amid the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy. Electricity consumption in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by robust activity in the services industries and various industrial sectors, including a rapid rise in solar PV, electric vehicle (EV) and battery production, and the electricity-intensive processing of related materials. Continued expansion of 5G networks and data centres as well as strong EV uptake in the domestic market are also contributing factors. Over the last three years, China has been adding electricity demand roughly equivalent to that of Germany each year, on average, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025, with growth forecast at 6.2%.\n\nIndia, the fastest growing major economy in the world, is forecast to post an 8% rise in electricity consumption in 2024, matching the rapid growth it saw in 2023. This is supported by strong GDP growth and increased cooling demand due to long and intense heatwaves. In the first half of 2024, the country grappled with heatwaves of record duration, with peak load reaching a new high and putting exceptional  strains  on  power  systems.  Assuming  a  return  to  average  weather conditions, we expect electricity demand growth in India to ease moderately to 6.8% in 2025.\n\nElectricity  demand in  the  United  States  is  set  to  rebound  significantly  in 2024, increasing by 3% year-on-year . The stronger growth rate is due, in part, to the comparison with 2023 when demand declined by 1.6% amid mild weather.\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: ## India's summer electricity demand surges amidst prolonged heatwaves\n\nIn early 2024, India grappled with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, driven by extreme heatwaves as well as strong growth in industrial and residential power  consumption.  During this period, the government  took emergency measures  to  manage  the  situation,  including  deferring  plant  maintenance  and reopening idled coal units. India also extended the operation of imported coalbased power plants until mid-October from the previous directive through June 2024. Additionally, the government considered similar mandates for gas-based power plants to further enhance capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn late May, India issued a heatwave alert as New Delhi saw temperatures soaring to 49°C. Just a day later, on May 30, 2024, India met an unprecedented maximum power demand of 250 GW driven by intense heat, expanding industrial activities, and  heightened  residential  power  consumption.  This  heatwave  has  been  the longest ever in duration to affect the country, enduring for approximately 24 days in various regions.\n\nDespite  this  surge  in  demand,  the  national  electricity  transmission  network remained stable, with no unscheduled interruptions reported. A peak demand of 258 GW for the rest of 2024 is expected. At the same time, the ability to meet electricity  demand  has  been  improving  over  the  last  few  years.  The  share  of demand that was unmet showed an overall declining trend since the second half of 2022, which continued well into H1 2024.\n\n## Electricity demand from data centres is in focus with the rise of artificial intelligence\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## India\n\n## Coal-fired supply remains the mainstay, but the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to reach the 25% mark in 2026\n\nNon-fossil-fuelled capacity accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in Q3 2023, with close to 21 GW of renewables added during the year. Renewable generation remained relatively stable with a 21% share of electricity generation in 2023, with a rise in solar and wind largely offset by reduced hydropower output.\n\nIndia's  electricity  demand  in  2023  was  heavily  influenced  by  varying  weather patterns. The country experienced the driest August in over 100 years and power demand  soared,  surpassing  240 GW  on  1 September  amid  increased  space cooling demand. The higher demand and low availability of hydropower resulted in  the  government  directing  all  generation  companies  and  independent  power producers (IPPs) to extend the mandate of blending a minimum of 6% of imported coal with domestic coal until March 2024 to ensure uninterrupted power supply.\n\nElectricity  demand  rose 7%  in  2023,  with  growth  forecast  at  close  to  6.5%  on average in 2024-2026. To meet rising demand, about 80 GW of additional thermal capacity is needed in the next decade according to the government. Coal-fired generation will remain dominant but is expected to fall from 74% of total electricity generation in 2023 to 68% in 2026. Renewable energy generation is forecast to grow from around 21% of the mix to reach a 25% share in 2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in India, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Global electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Due to the rising  contribution  of renewables  and  declining  coal  share,  in  2023 Australia continued to see reductions in both total emissions (-5%) and emissions intensity (-4%). We expect emissions intensity to continue declining by around 5% annually on average to 2026, while total power sector emissions fall 3% per year on average.\n\nIn  December  2023  Australia  opened  the  first  bids  in  its  Capacity  Investment Scheme, which was established at the end of 2022 to encourage investment in\n\ndispatchable renewable energy. Emissions reduction ambitions for electricity are also now reflected in law, with the inclusion of an emissions reduction objective in the National Electricity Objective.\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n## Strong economic growth drives the region's electricity demand in the 2024-2026 outlook period\n\nIn 2023, electricity demand grew by 4.6% in Southeast Asia, down from 7% in 2022, and below the average 6% observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019. Electricity demand growth is forecast to accelerate to an average 5.3% from  2024  to  2026,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth  in  the  region  via expanding industries and rising electricity consumption per household. Growth in Indonesia, the largest electricity consumer in region with a share of just below 30%, will underpin the gains, rising by an annual average of 6.3% in 2024-2026.\n\n## Year-on-year change in electricity generation in Southeast Asia, 2019-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

As a result, electricity demand in these sectors rose by around 60-65% between  2014  and  2024.  While  good  interconnections  among  states  and  the operation of thermal power plants allow Indian utilities to cover demand in energy terms throughout the year, the rapid increase in yearly peak load poses a major challenge for the electricity grid and national authorities.\n\nEven  though  less  than  20%  of  households  in  India  are  equipped  with  an  air conditioner, the contribution of cooling to total peak load is estimated at 60 GW in 2024, as sales reached a new record of 14 million AC units sold in 2024. This is 27%  more  than  in  2023,  when  11 million  units  were  sold.  By  2030,  cooling equipment is expected to contribute one-third to the peak electricity load in India, potentially reaching 140 GW. This would be more in line with trends in advanced\n\neconomies such as the United States, where cooling demand currently takes 50% of  total  peak  load  on  the  warmest  days  in  Texas.  Data  shows  that  for  each incremental  degree  in  daily  average  temperature,  daily  peak  demand  in  India increased by more than 7 GW in 2024, twice the increase observed in 2019.

Peak electricity load in India has shown strong growth in recent years, and a dedicated section in this chapter provides a detailed analysis of peak load trends and the successful impact of India's time-of-use tariffs.\n\nElectricity demand  in  advanced  economies,  in  aggregate,  was  effectively unchanged in 2024 compared to 2021. During this period, the growth in global electricity demand has come from emerging economies and developing markets. However, through 2027, we expect the share of advanced economies in additional electricity demand to increase to around 15%, as electrification of the transport and  heating  sectors  continues,  and  data  centres  expand  rapidly.  While  in  the United  States  the  growth  projections  for  data  centres  are  a  key  driver  of  the electricity  demand  trends,  in  the  European  Union  uncertainty  surrounding  the recovery in energy-intensive industries and the impact on electricity demand is a central topic and is covered in detail.\n\n## Change in electricity demand by region, 202 1 -2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

According to the Special Action Plan for Green and Low-Carbon Development  of  Data  Centres  (2024),  China  has  set  objectives  to  reduce  the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) 7  of data centres to below 1.5, improve the average Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) and to increase the overall on-load rate to no less than 60% by the end of 2025. Similarly, the 2024 Action Plan included goals to increase the share of clean energy  in  data  centres'  electricity  consumption,  setting  targets  for  the  overall utilisation rate of renewable energy to increase by 10% annually for data centres and for EDWC data centres to source at least 80% of their electricity consumption from renewables by 2025.\n\n## Strong growth in peak electricity load in India amid economic growth and rising AC usage\n\nFollowing a strong 8.3% increase in 2023, electricity demand in India grew 5.8% y-o-y in 2024 amid strong economic growth. While electricity consumption rose by a robust 8.5% during the first half of the year due to intense and long heatwaves, the  second  half  saw  a  more  subdued  growth  in  demand  amid milder  weather. Supported  by  rapid  economic  expansion  and  increasing  electrification,  India's electricity demand is forecast to grow at a high rate of 6.3% annually from 2025 to 2027  on  average.  Rising  air  conditioner  ownership  will  continue  to  bolster electricity demand growth.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: ## India\n\n## Electricity demand continued to grow strongly amidst robust economic growth and record heatwaves\n\nElectricity demand in India increased by 5.8% in 2024 y-o-y, driven by a rapidly expanding economy that is estimated to grow by 7% in 2024, according to the IMF, and intense heatwaves, which further boosted power needs. Peak power use reached  a  record  250 GW  in  May,  surpassing  the  previous  high  of  243 GW recorded in September 2023. Total electricity generation increased by 15% y-o-y to  168 TWh  in  May  compared  to  the  same  month  in  2023,  driven  by  an unprecedented  heatwave  that  led  to  a  spike  in  cooling  demand.  According  to India's Ministry of Power, by 2030 peak electricity demand is forecast to exceed 400 GW, with 65% of capacity expected to come from non-fossil fuel sources.\n\nIn February 2023, the Ministry of Power invoked Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003,  which  directed  all  imported  coal-based  power  plants  to  operate  at  full capacity to avoid electricity shortages. This was extended multiple times, and the latest extension mandated that imported coal-based power plants operate at full capacity until the end of February 2025. Section 11 was also used to direct gasfired power stations to operationalise according to government instruction for the months of May and June last year.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: ## Daily peak load in cooling season compared to average temperature in India, 2019-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Global electricity demand rose by 4.3% in 2024 and is forecast to continue to grow at close to 4% out to 2027. Over the next  three  years,  global  electricity  consumption  is  forecast  to  rise  by  an unprecedented 3 500 TWh.  This corresponds to adding more than the equivalent of a Japan to the world's electricity consumption each year. This is also a sharp acceleration over the 2.5% increase in 2023, when strong gains in China, India and Southeast Asia were tempered by declines in advanced economies.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies, led by China, are the main drivers of electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: Hydropower saw an increase of 2.5% y-o-y, following a large 17% decrease in hydropower generation in 2023.

While coal remains the primary source, gas-fired generation is also rising, though from a much lower base, with an estimated growth of 6% y-o-y in 2024, and further increases are forecast for the next three years at an average 9% annually.\n\nThe  share  of  renewable  energy  is  on  course  to  significantly  expand  as  new capacity  additions  in  wind,  solar  and  hydropower  come  online.  Although  coalbased  power  generation  has  grown  at  a  4%  compound  average  growth  rate (CAGR) from 2018-2024, this is projected to slow to around 2% between 20252027, reflecting a gradual shift towards cleaner energy sources.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption in India', 'year': '2025'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption in India', 'year': '2025'}, log="Year: 2025\nContent: Peak electricity load in India has shown strong growth in recent years, rising from 148 GW in 2014 to 250 GW (+68%) in 2024, led higher by the rapid expansion of its industry, development  of agriculture, enhanced  electricity access and increased use of air conditioning and appliances in the residential and commercial sectors. As a result, electricity demand in these sectors rose by around 60-65% between  2014  and  2024.  While  good  interconnections  among  states  and  the operation of thermal power plants allow Indian utilities to cover demand in energy terms throughout the year, the rapid increase in yearly peak load poses a major challenge for the electricity grid and national authorities.\n\nEven  though  less  than  20%  of  households  in  India  are  equipped  with  an  air conditioner, the contribution of cooling to total peak load is estimated at 60 GW in 2024, as sales reached a new record of 14 million AC units sold in 2024. This is 27%  more  than  in  2023,  when  11 million  units  were  sold.  By  2030,  cooling equipment is expected to contribute one-third to the peak electricity load in India, potentially reaching 140 GW.

The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: (2.9 Wh per request), and considering 9 billion searches daily, this would require almost 10 TWh of additional electricity in a year.\n\nAI electricity demand can be forecast more comprehensively based on the amount of AI servers that are estimated to be sold in the future and their rated power. The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually. By 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023.\n\n## Estimated electricity demand from traditional data centres, dedicated AI data centres and cryptocurrencies, 2022 and 2026, base case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNote: Data centre electricity demand excludes consumption from data network centres.\n\nSources: IEA forecast based on data and projections from Data Centres and Data Transmission Networks; Joule (2023), Alex de Vries, The growing energy footprint of artificial intelligence; Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, Indices; Ireland Central Statistics Office, Data Centres Metered Electricity Consumption 2022; and Danish Energy Agency, Denmark's\n\nEnergy and Climate Outlook 2018.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: ## Southeast Asia and India make strides in per capita electricity use, but Africa lags behind\n\nIn 1990, the average electricity consumption per person in Africa exceeded that of Southeast  Asia  by  40%  and  India  by  65%.  However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Electricity  demand in India rose  by  7%  in  2023  compared to last year's 8.6%. Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Smart meters not only enable better and more detailed data collection, which can be used for an improved assessment of self-consumption, among other things, but can also enable considerable cost savings. For example, in 2018 alone, with an installation cost of EUR 180-200, smart meters in the European Union have reportedly  allowed  yearly  savings  of  EUR 280 per  metering  point  on  average among the member states, which are based on direct and indirect benefits for consumers.  Direct  consumer  benefits  derive  from  an  observed  behavioural change in energy consumption triggered by the awareness of the granular data from smart meters. Additionally, timely information about dynamic tariffs motivates consumers to shift their energy consumption to times when is most economically convenient.  Indirect  benefits  are  enabled  by  an  improvement  on  the  utility's operations, for example, by remote management of the metering system.\n\n## Supply: Clean electricity to meet all additional demand out to 2026\n\n## Renewables overtake coal as the largest source of global electricity supply in 2025\n\nOur forecast period out to 2026 is characterised by three turning points with regard to low-carbon electricity sources. First, renewables are expected to generate more than one-third of world's electricity in 2025, overtaking coal as the largest source of supply. Second, low-carbon sources - renewables and nuclear together - are expected to account for 46% of the world's electricity generation by the end of 2026, rapidly approaching the halfway mark, up from 39% in 2023. And finally, on a global scale, low-carbon generation is set to meet all the additional demand growth towards 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union, data centre electricity consumption is estimated at slightly below 100 TWh in 2022, almost 4% of total EU electricity demand. Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Year-on-year percent change in global electricity demand, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs in 2023, China and India are on track to post robust increases in electricity demand in 2024, driven by economic growth and rising cooling needs. The United States is also set to see significant demand growth, boosted by stronger economic activity, following a decline in 2023 driven by mild weather. After two consecutive years of decline, the European Union's demand is recovering, albeit at a moderate pace, as various energy-intensive industries ramp-up operations. The sustained increases in  electricity  consumption  in  these  regions  amid  rising  electrification, combined with robust growth in other emerging economies, is expected to support global electricity demand in 2025 at a similar rate of 4%.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electricity demand in China propelled higher by a rapid rise in EV and solar PV production\n\nFollowing a strong 7% y-o-y increase in electricity consumption in 2023, growth in continued at an estimated rate of around 6.5% in H1 2024. For full year, demand growth of 6.5% is forecast, before moderately easing to 6.2% in 2025.\n\nChina Despite  the  expected  slowdown  in  the  Chinese  economy  and  the  continuing structural shift to towards becoming less reliant on heavy industries, the rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules, electric vehicles, batteries, and the processing of related materials are all supporting electricity demand growth. Data centres and 5G networks with increasing digitalisation are other important drivers. Over  the  last  three  years,  China  has  been  adding  on  average  roughly  one Germany each year in terms of electricity demand and this trend is expected to continue through 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log="Year: 2025\nContent: ## Data centres are a key driver of electricity demand growth in the United States\n\nThe rapid expansion of data centres in the United States has positioned the sector as a major catalyst of electricity demand growth, which will have a substantial impact on the country's energy landscape. A recent study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy highlights the strong growth in electricity consumption by data centres, which rose from about 60 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023, and constituted more than 4% of the country's total electricity  use.  Their  scenarios indicate  this  consumption  could  rise  by  an  additional  150 TWh  to  400 TWh  by 2028, reaching about 325 TWh to 580 TWh, and accounting for 6.7% to 12% of total US electricity demand. The growth trend is supported by the record pace of new data centre announcements. In the first half of 2024 alone, announced data centre projects were associated with nearly 24 GW of power capacity needs triple the amount stated during the same period in 2023.\n\n## Estimated drivers of change in electricity demand in the United States, 2024 vs. 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

CC BY 4.0.\n\n## Electricity demand in advanced economies is rising, reversing a 15-year declining trend\n\nIn advanced economies, electricity demand - both in total and per capita - has stayed relatively flat or even declined since 2009, as in the case of Japan, although GDP PPP per capita has continued to rise. This change in the GDP and electricity demand  dynamic  in  advanced  economies  reflects  a  combination  of  increased\n\nefficiency  gains  across  all  end-use  sectors,  most  notably  in  LED  lighting  and appliances as well as heavy industries moving abroad to developing economies over the past several decades. Now, once again, we expect electricity demand in advanced economies to start rising alongside economic growth, in a reversal of the  trend  over  the  past  15  years.  This  is  driven  by  a  combination  of  rising consumption from electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps.\n\n## Evolution of per capita electricity consumption and GDP in selected regions throughout the years, 1990-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Many advanced economies - such as Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea and the United States - are expected to see electricity consumption rise through 2027 following increases in 2024. In advanced economies, electricity demand - both in total and per capita - has stayed relatively flat or even declined since  2009  even  as  the  economies  themselves  have  continued  to  grow.  This dynamic in advanced economies reflected a combination of increased efficiency gains across all end-use sectors, most notably in lighting and appliances, as well as  the  restructuring  and  relocation  of  heavy  industries  over  the  past  several decades.  Now,  once  again,  electricity  demand  in  advanced  economies  is expected to start rising significantly alongside economic growth, bucking the trend of the past 15 years. This is driven by higher consumption from the deployment of electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps, among other enduse technologies.\n\nIn the United States, the world's second-largest electricity consumer after China, demand rebounded in 2024, growing by 2% to reach a new high. This followed a 1.8% decline in 2023 due to mild weather and weaker manufacturing activity. We expect US electricity demand to grow at an average annual rate of 2%\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: While some studies clearly indicate whether they include or exclude data networks in their estimates, many of the published estimates are not clear on their scope of analysis  or  other  methodological  details.  Based  on  our  analysis  of  published company-level disclosures on energy use, it appears likely that many studies also include  the  electricity consumption  of  networks  in  their  energy  estimates. Therefore, in order to identify trends for data centres correctly, it is important to separately understand the electricity consumption trends of networks.\n\nBased on the electricity use data published by China's largest telecommunication operators, including China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, we estimate that telecommunication networks in China consumed 90-110 TWh in 2023, with our central estimate being 100 TWh 3 . This total includes mobile networks (3G, 4G, and 5G) as well as fixed access and core networks. We estimate 5G networks consumed around 30 TWh and 3G/4G around 35 TWh in 2023 4 , with the rest from fixed and core networks.\n\n## Electricity demand projections for the data centre sector in China from multiple sources, possibly including telecommunication networks, 2015-2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNote: Some of the sources very likely include electricity demand numbers for telecommunication networks in addition to data centres. These are plotted in dashed lines.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: Over the period 2025-2027, we estimate that electricity consumption will grow on average by 3.3% per year. Gas-fired electricity generation is expected to decline by around 1% annually in 2025-2027, whereas renewables will continue to see strong growth of 12% over the outlook period. We anticipate solar PV and wind power generation to be the primary drivers of increased renewables, averaging growth of 32% and 12%, respectively.\n\nData  centres  in  Ireland  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  6.3 TWh  in  2023, according  to  the  Central  Statistics  Office,  an  increase  of  20%  over  2022. Accordingly, data centres accounted for about 20% of total electricity consumption in 2023, more than the 18% of total electricity consumption by urban households. Data centres are scrutinised closely at the planning stage, with some applications rejected due to concerns such as how their operation would affect the grid.\n\nAdditional  investment  of  EUR 750 million  was  injected  into the  development  of electricity  grid  infrastructure,  particularly  for  offshore  grid  development.  One aspect of back-up to the grid will be provided by the Moneypoint 900 MW power\n\nstation.  This  was  originally  a  coal-fired  power station  but  is  being  converted  to heavy fuel oil where it will operate as a generator of last resort until 2029. The 700 MW  Celtic  Interconnector  project,  which  will  allow  electricity  exchange between  France  and  Ireland,  is  under  construction  and  scheduled  to  become operational in 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: China aims to not only achieve growth in computing power but also efficiency improvements. According to the Special Action Plan for Green and Low-Carbon Development  of  Data  Centres  (2024),  China  has  set  objectives  to  reduce  the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) 7  of data centres to below 1.5, improve the average Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) and to increase the overall on-load rate to no less than 60% by the end of 2025. Similarly, the 2024 Action Plan included goals to increase the share of clean energy  in  data  centres'  electricity  consumption,  setting  targets  for  the  overall utilisation rate of renewable energy to increase by 10% annually for data centres and for EDWC data centres to source at least 80% of their electricity consumption from renewables by 2025.\n\n## Strong growth in peak electricity load in India amid economic growth and rising AC usage\n\nFollowing a strong 8.3% increase in 2023, electricity demand in India grew 5.8% y-o-y in 2024 amid strong economic growth. While electricity consumption rose by a robust 8.5% during the first half of the year due to intense and long heatwaves, the  second  half  saw  a  more  subdued  growth  in  demand  amid milder  weather. Supported  by  rapid  economic  expansion  and  increasing  electrification,  India's electricity demand is forecast to grow at a high rate of 6.3% annually from 2025 to 2027  on  average.

GDP growth is based on the October 2024 edition of the IMF World Economic Outlook.\n\nWhat is clear is that from 2020 onward Chinese electricity demand growth has outpaced GDP due to a convergence of factors that paved the way for increased electrification  in  the  country.  Our  analysis  shows  that  the  rapid  electrification across all sectors has had a major transformative impact of increasing electricity demand  beyond  economic  growth.  The  share  of  electricity in total final consumption in China is estimated at 28% in 2024, up from 27% in 2023. The share of electricity in total final consumption is currently estimated at 22% in the United States and 21% in the European Union.\n\nIn sectors outside of industry, important catalysts of higher electricity consumption include the growing stock of air conditioners, expansion of data centres and 5G, and  stronger  EV  charging  demand.  In  the  industry  sector,  alongside  rising electrification, the sharp increase in electricity-intensive production of new energy\n\nproducts such as PV modules, batteries and EVs has been a major source of growth  in  recent  years.  While  overall  GDP  is  following  its  2008-2020  trend, industrial electricity demand growth has been higher than the economy's pace of expansion. As a result, even though the economy is slowing down in aggregate, total  electricity  demand growth remains robust as the country overall becomes more electricity-intensive.\n\n## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

With an analysis based on FERC Form 714 filings of the planning areas,  the  study  shows  that  the  aggregate  electricity  consumption  forecast  for 2029  has  been  moving  upwards  since  2023.  The  aggregate  net  electricity consumption forecast in 2022 for 2029 was 4 375 TWh. In 2023, this figure was revised upwards significantly, to 4 553 TWh, and in 2024 even more sharply to 4 773 TWh. Assuming the realised net electricity demand for 2024 of 4 090 TWh\n\nas  the  baseline,  this  corresponds  to  average  annual  growth  of  1.4%  for  the 2025-2029 period for the aggregate submissions in 2022, and upward revised values of 2.2% for submissions in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. 11\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: ## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

Over the threeyear period from 2022 to 2024, 48% of the increase in Chinese electricity demand came from the industry sector. The manufacturing of PV modules, batteries, and EVs  excluding  the  processing  of  associated  materials  are  estimated  to  have consumed around 320 TWh of electricity in 2024 - as much electricity as Italy uses in a year. The increase in consumption of these sectors has been remarkable in recent  years,  which  rose  by  more  than  230  TWh  over  2022-2024.  During  this period, new energy products made up nearly 35% of the increase in industrial electricity  demand and 16% of the growth in total electricity use across China. Including the numerous electricity-intensive upstream processes associated with these products that take place in China, such as the refining and processing of the related materials, can further boost these numbers.\n\nOver 2025-2027, we expect the industry sector to make up roughly 50% of the additional demand growth. Industrial demand, excluding that associated with new energy products, is forecast to record higher growth than it recorded in the prior\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: Our projections anticipate a delayed phase out of coal for supply security reasons, and coal-fired generation is expected to retain a 6% share in Israel's generation mix in 2027 (down from 12% in 2024). The share of gas in the power mix remains steady  at  just  over  70%  throughout  the  forecast,  while  the  contribution  of renewables increases from 16% to 23% between 2024 and 2027.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Africa\n\n## Electricity consumption growth is hampered by insufficient generation capacity\n\nElectricity demand in Africa grew by an estimated 3.4% in 2024, up from just under 2% in 2023. South Africa bounced back from a contraction in demand in 2023 to growth of 4.1% as new capacity was brought online and the power sector limited load shedding. Egypt saw an increase in the yearly rate of demand growth to 1.6% and Algeria continued the trend of strong growth of recent years with a rise of 5.4%. These three countries combined consume over half of all electricity in Africa. We expect this trend of rising electricity demand throughout much of the continent to  continue  over  the  2025-2027  period,  averaging  approximately  5%  per  year. Nevertheless,  electricity  consumption  growth  is  hampered,  especially  in  subSaharan Africa, due to lack of supply.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand, Africa, 2020-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The gains will  be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion  of  the  data  centre  sector.  The  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While  this  is  progress,  electrification  needs  to  accelerate  rapidly  to  meet  the world's  decarbonisation  targets.  In  the  IEA's  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, electricity's share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\n\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency  sector  could  double  by  2026. Data  centres  are  significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an  estimated  460  terawatt-hours (TWh)  in  2022,  data  centres'  total  electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent  to  the  electricity  consumption  of  Japan.  Updated  regulations  and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\n\n## Emerging and developing economies are the engines of global electricity demand growth\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: (2.9 Wh per request), and considering 9 billion searches daily, this would require almost 10 TWh of additional electricity in a year.\n\nAI electricity demand can be forecast more comprehensively based on the amount of AI servers that are estimated to be sold in the future and their rated power. The AI server market is currently dominated by tech firm NVIDIA, with an estimated 95%  market  share.  In  2023,  NVIDIA  shipped  100 000  units  that  consume  an average of 7.3 TWh of electricity annually. By 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023.\n\n## Estimated electricity demand from traditional data centres, dedicated AI data centres and cryptocurrencies, 2022 and 2026, base case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Continued rapid economic expansion and robust demand for space cooling were the main pillars of growth. After two consecutive years of strong gains, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined at the end of  2023.  Bolstered  by  a  fast-growing  economy  and  powered  by  increased electrification, we expect India's electricity demand to rise by an annual average of  6.5% over the 2024-2026 period. While China provides the largest share of demand growth in terms of volume, India posts the fastest growth rate out to 2026 among major economies. Following this, India will have added additional electricity demand roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  over  the  next  three years.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in China, European Union, and the United States, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Another  promising  field  of  research  for  decarbonising  data  centre  operations involves time and location shifting of electricity demand. Software developments can allow operators to temporarily shift power loads with carbon-aware models that  relocate  data  centre  workloads  to  regions  with  lower  carbon  intensity  at selected times. Simultaneously, such methodology has shown the probability of increasing  the  operational  affordability  by  reducing  costs  of  consuming  lowemissions energy around the clock by up to 34%. Results of this methodology combined with other energy efficiency measures in place and on-site low-emission energy production have demonstrated that data centres can achieve a 64% share of carbon-free energy in their total electricity consumption, according to Google's 2023 Environmental Report.\n\n## Rising self-consumption in distributed systems and data collection challenges\n\nAs part  of  the  energy  transition,  distributed  generation  has  been  increasing  in many parts of the world. This is most notably reflected in rising rooftop solar PV installations  and  growing  amounts  of  self-consumption  from  behind-the-meter solar  PV.  By  2022,  self-consumption  from  distributed  solar  PV  generation accounted for about 2% of total electricity demand in Italy. In countries such as Germany, Spain, Brazil and Japan this share is estimated to be around 1% of total electricity demand in 2022. However, an accelerating trend in Spain and Brazil can be observed.\n\n## Estimated electricity self-consumption in distributed systems and its share in total electricity demand in selected countries, 2019-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: While electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for  the  2024-26  period  anticipates  average  annual  growth  in  total  electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\n\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key  reason  for  the  decline  was  milder  weather  in  2023  compared  with  2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: Smart meters not only enable better and more detailed data collection, which can be used for an improved assessment of self-consumption, among other things, but can also enable considerable cost savings. For example, in 2018 alone, with an installation cost of EUR 180-200, smart meters in the European Union have reportedly  allowed  yearly  savings  of  EUR 280 per  metering  point  on  average among the member states, which are based on direct and indirect benefits for consumers.  Direct  consumer  benefits  derive  from  an  observed  behavioural change in energy consumption triggered by the awareness of the granular data from smart meters. Additionally, timely information about dynamic tariffs motivates consumers to shift their energy consumption to times when is most economically convenient.  Indirect  benefits  are  enabled  by  an  improvement  on  the  utility's operations, for example, by remote management of the metering system.\n\n## Supply: Clean electricity to meet all additional demand out to 2026\n\n## Renewables overtake coal as the largest source of global electricity supply in 2025\n\nOur forecast period out to 2026 is characterised by three turning points with regard to low-carbon electricity sources. First, renewables are expected to generate more than one-third of world's electricity in 2025, overtaking coal as the largest source of supply. Second, low-carbon sources - renewables and nuclear together - are expected to account for 46% of the world's electricity generation by the end of 2026, rapidly approaching the halfway mark, up from 39% in 2023. And finally, on a global scale, low-carbon generation is set to meet all the additional demand growth towards 2026.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: In the European Union, data centre electricity consumption is estimated at slightly below 100 TWh in 2022, almost 4% of total EU electricity demand. Around 1 240 data centres were operating within Europe in 2022, with the majority concentrated in the financial centres of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin. With a significant number  of  additional  data  centres  planned,  as  well  as  new deployments  that  can  be  expected  to  be  realised  over  the  coming  years,  we forecast that  electricity  consumption  in  the  data  centre  sector  in  the  European Union will reach almost 150 TWh by 2026.\n\n## Almost one-third of electricity demand in Ireland could come from data centres by 2026\n\nIn Europe, the data centre market in Ireland is developing rapidly as their electricity consumption grows along with new policies and initiatives. Electricity demand from data centres in Ireland was 5.3 TWh in 2022, representing 17% of the country's total electricity consumed. That is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by urban residential buildings. At this pace, in a high case scenario, Ireland's data centres might double  their electricity consumption  by  2026,  and  with  AI applications penetrating the market at a fast rate, the sector could reach a share of 32% of the country's total electricity demand in 2026 if most of the approved projects are able to be connected to the system. This assumes that at the same time efficiency gains in other sectors continue to take place.\n\nIreland's stock of data centres, currently at 82, is expected to grow by 65% in the coming years, with 14 data centres under construction and 40 approved to start\n\n---\nYear: mid-year-update-july-2024\nContent: Year-on-year percent change in global electricity demand, 1991-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs in 2023, China and India are on track to post robust increases in electricity demand in 2024, driven by economic growth and rising cooling needs. The United States is also set to see significant demand growth, boosted by stronger economic activity, following a decline in 2023 driven by mild weather. After two consecutive years of decline, the European Union's demand is recovering, albeit at a moderate pace, as various energy-intensive industries ramp-up operations. The sustained increases in  electricity  consumption  in  these  regions  amid  rising  electrification, combined with robust growth in other emerging economies, is expected to support global electricity demand in 2025 at a similar rate of 4%.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand in selected regions, 2019-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electricity demand in China propelled higher by a rapid rise in EV and solar PV production\n\nFollowing a strong 7% y-o-y increase in electricity consumption in 2023, growth in continued at an estimated rate of around 6.5% in H1 2024. For full year, demand growth of 6.5% is forecast, before moderately easing to 6.2% in 2025.\n\nChina Despite  the  expected  slowdown  in  the  Chinese  economy  and  the  continuing structural shift to towards becoming less reliant on heavy industries, the rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules, electric vehicles, batteries, and the processing of related materials are all supporting electricity demand growth. Data centres and 5G networks with increasing digitalisation are other important drivers. Over  the  last  three  years,  China  has  been  adding  on  average  roughly  one Germany each year in terms of electricity demand and this trend is expected to continue through 2025.\n\n---\nYear: 2024\nContent: For  the  2024-2026  period,  we  estimate  electricity  consumption  to  grow  by  an average of almost 7% per year, which is the highest demand growth rate in Europe in our forecast. This strong increase will be driven by a rapid expansion in the data centre sector. We forecast average year-on-year declines in gas-fired electricity of  0.5%  out  to  2026,  with  strong  demand  growth  preventing  more  substantial declines  despite  strong  growth  in  renewables.  We  expect  renewables  to  grow faster over this period at an annual average rate of around 13%, largely driven by wind.\n\nIn  Ireland,  data  centres  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  about  5.3 TWh  of electricity  in  2022,  up  by  31%  compared  to  2021.  This  accounts  for  17%  of Ireland's electricity demand, equivalent to the consumption of all urban dwellings. Considering a high-case scenario with current projections and announced plans, we estimate that this could reach around 12 TWh by 2026, when it could make up more than 30% of national electricity demand. The state-owned TSO EirGrid has imposed a de facto moratorium on data centres in Greater Dublin due to a rapid growth in data centre stock, hence grid congestion especially in that area. The moratorium prohibits the submission of data centre planning applications from late 2022 to 2028 but does not impede contracts that are already in the pipeline. Some data centres have instead connected to Dublin's gas network to produce their own power as an alternative to connecting to Ireland's electricity network but this workaround was also closed by the government.\n"), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log='TBD'), AgentAction(tool='rag_search_filter', tool_input={'query': 'Electricity Consumption', 'year': '2025'}, log="Year: 2025\nContent: ## Data centres are a key driver of electricity demand growth in the United States\n\nThe rapid expansion of data centres in the United States has positioned the sector as a major catalyst of electricity demand growth, which will have a substantial impact on the country's energy landscape. A recent study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy highlights the strong growth in electricity consumption by data centres, which rose from about 60 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023, and constituted more than 4% of the country's total electricity  use.  Their  scenarios indicate  this  consumption  could  rise  by  an  additional  150 TWh  to  400 TWh  by 2028, reaching about 325 TWh to 580 TWh, and accounting for 6.7% to 12% of total US electricity demand. The growth trend is supported by the record pace of new data centre announcements. In the first half of 2024 alone, announced data centre projects were associated with nearly 24 GW of power capacity needs triple the amount stated during the same period in 2023.\n\n## Estimated drivers of change in electricity demand in the United States, 2024 vs. 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

This change in the GDP and electricity demand  dynamic  in  advanced  economies  reflects  a  combination  of  increased\n\nefficiency  gains  across  all  end-use  sectors,  most  notably  in  LED  lighting  and appliances as well as heavy industries moving abroad to developing economies over the past several decades. Now, once again, we expect electricity demand in advanced economies to start rising alongside economic growth, in a reversal of the  trend  over  the  past  15  years.  This  is  driven  by  a  combination  of  rising consumption from electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps.\n\n## Evolution of per capita electricity consumption and GDP in selected regions throughout the years, 1990-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Many advanced economies - such as Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea and the United States - are expected to see electricity consumption rise through 2027 following increases in 2024. In advanced economies, electricity demand - both in total and per capita - has stayed relatively flat or even declined since  2009  even  as  the  economies  themselves  have  continued  to  grow.  This dynamic in advanced economies reflected a combination of increased efficiency gains across all end-use sectors, most notably in lighting and appliances, as well as  the  restructuring  and  relocation  of  heavy  industries  over  the  past  several decades.  Now,  once  again,  electricity  demand  in  advanced  economies  is expected to start rising significantly alongside economic growth, bucking the trend of the past 15 years. This is driven by higher consumption from the deployment of electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centres and heat pumps, among other enduse technologies.\n\nIn the United States, the world's second-largest electricity consumer after China, demand rebounded in 2024, growing by 2% to reach a new high. This followed a 1.8% decline in 2023 due to mild weather and weaker manufacturing activity. We expect US electricity demand to grow at an average annual rate of 2%\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: While some studies clearly indicate whether they include or exclude data networks in their estimates, many of the published estimates are not clear on their scope of analysis  or  other  methodological  details.  Based  on  our  analysis  of  published company-level disclosures on energy use, it appears likely that many studies also include  the  electricity consumption  of  networks  in  their  energy  estimates. Therefore, in order to identify trends for data centres correctly, it is important to separately understand the electricity consumption trends of networks.\n\nBased on the electricity use data published by China's largest telecommunication operators, including China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, we estimate that telecommunication networks in China consumed 90-110 TWh in 2023, with our central estimate being 100 TWh 3 . This total includes mobile networks (3G, 4G, and 5G) as well as fixed access and core networks. We estimate 5G networks consumed around 30 TWh and 3G/4G around 35 TWh in 2023 4 , with the rest from fixed and core networks.\n\n## Electricity demand projections for the data centre sector in China from multiple sources, possibly including telecommunication networks, 2015-2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Gas-fired electricity generation is expected to decline by around 1% annually in 2025-2027, whereas renewables will continue to see strong growth of 12% over the outlook period. We anticipate solar PV and wind power generation to be the primary drivers of increased renewables, averaging growth of 32% and 12%, respectively.\n\nData  centres  in  Ireland  are  estimated  to  have  consumed  6.3 TWh  in  2023, according  to  the  Central  Statistics  Office,  an  increase  of  20%  over  2022. Accordingly, data centres accounted for about 20% of total electricity consumption in 2023, more than the 18% of total electricity consumption by urban households. Data centres are scrutinised closely at the planning stage, with some applications rejected due to concerns such as how their operation would affect the grid.\n\nAdditional  investment  of  EUR 750 million  was  injected  into the  development  of electricity  grid  infrastructure,  particularly  for  offshore  grid  development.  One aspect of back-up to the grid will be provided by the Moneypoint 900 MW power\n\nstation.  This  was  originally  a  coal-fired  power station  but  is  being  converted  to heavy fuel oil where it will operate as a generator of last resort until 2029.

According to the Special Action Plan for Green and Low-Carbon Development  of  Data  Centres  (2024),  China  has  set  objectives  to  reduce  the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) 7  of data centres to below 1.5, improve the average Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) and to increase the overall on-load rate to no less than 60% by the end of 2025. Similarly, the 2024 Action Plan included goals to increase the share of clean energy  in  data  centres'  electricity  consumption,  setting  targets  for  the  overall utilisation rate of renewable energy to increase by 10% annually for data centres and for EDWC data centres to source at least 80% of their electricity consumption from renewables by 2025.\n\n## Strong growth in peak electricity load in India amid economic growth and rising AC usage\n\nFollowing a strong 8.3% increase in 2023, electricity demand in India grew 5.8% y-o-y in 2024 amid strong economic growth. While electricity consumption rose by a robust 8.5% during the first half of the year due to intense and long heatwaves, the  second  half  saw  a  more  subdued  growth  in  demand  amid milder  weather. Supported  by  rapid  economic  expansion  and  increasing  electrification,  India's electricity demand is forecast to grow at a high rate of 6.3% annually from 2025 to 2027  on  average.  Rising  air  conditioner  ownership  will  continue  to  bolster electricity demand growth.\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: <!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

GDP growth is based on the October 2024 edition of the IMF World Economic Outlook.\n\nWhat is clear is that from 2020 onward Chinese electricity demand growth has outpaced GDP due to a convergence of factors that paved the way for increased electrification  in  the  country.  Our  analysis  shows  that  the  rapid  electrification across all sectors has had a major transformative impact of increasing electricity demand  beyond  economic  growth.  The  share  of  electricity in total final consumption in China is estimated at 28% in 2024, up from 27% in 2023. The share of electricity in total final consumption is currently estimated at 22% in the United States and 21% in the European Union.\n\nIn sectors outside of industry, important catalysts of higher electricity consumption include the growing stock of air conditioners, expansion of data centres and 5G, and  stronger  EV  charging  demand.  In  the  industry  sector,  alongside  rising electrification, the sharp increase in electricity-intensive production of new energy\n\nproducts such as PV modules, batteries and EVs has been a major source of growth  in  recent  years.  While  overall  GDP  is  following  its  2008-2020  trend, industrial electricity demand growth has been higher than the economy's pace of expansion. As a result, even though the economy is slowing down in aggregate, total  electricity  demand growth remains robust as the country overall becomes more electricity-intensive.\n\n## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

With an analysis based on FERC Form 714 filings of the planning areas,  the  study  shows  that  the  aggregate  electricity  consumption  forecast  for 2029  has  been  moving  upwards  since  2023.  The  aggregate  net  electricity consumption forecast in 2022 for 2029 was 4 375 TWh. In 2023, this figure was revised upwards significantly, to 4 553 TWh, and in 2024 even more sharply to 4 773 TWh. Assuming the realised net electricity demand for 2024 of 4 090 TWh\n\nas  the  baseline,  this  corresponds  to  average  annual  growth  of  1.4%  for  the 2025-2029 period for the aggregate submissions in 2022, and upward revised values of 2.2% for submissions in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. 11\n\n---\nYear: 2025\nContent: ## Growth rates of sectoral electricity demand and GDP in China, 2000-2027\n\n2027\n\nIEA.

Over the threeyear period from 2022 to 2024, 48% of the increase in Chinese electricity demand came from the industry sector. The manufacturing of PV modules, batteries, and EVs  excluding  the  processing  of  associated  materials  are  estimated  to  have consumed around 320 TWh of electricity in 2024 - as much electricity as Italy uses in a year. The increase in consumption of these sectors has been remarkable in recent  years,  which  rose  by  more  than  230  TWh  over  2022-2024.  During  this period, new energy products made up nearly 35% of the increase in industrial electricity  demand and 16% of the growth in total electricity use across China. Including the numerous electricity-intensive upstream processes associated with these products that take place in China, such as the refining and processing of the related materials, can further boost these numbers.\n\nOver 2025-2027, we expect the industry sector to make up roughly 50% of the additional demand growth.

South Africa bounced back from a contraction in demand in 2023 to growth of 4.1% as new capacity was brought online and the power sector limited load shedding. Egypt saw an increase in the yearly rate of demand growth to 1.6% and Algeria continued the trend of strong growth of recent years with a rise of 5.4%. These three countries combined consume over half of all electricity in Africa. We expect this trend of rising electricity demand throughout much of the continent to  continue  over  the  2025-2027  period,  averaging  approximately  5%  per  year. Nevertheless,  electricity  consumption  growth  is  hampered,  especially  in  subSaharan Africa, due to lack of supply.\n\n## Year-on-year percent change in electricity demand, Africa, 2020-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh.

Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace.

In 2023, electricity demand in India increased by 7%, marking a continuation of a trend observed over the previous years. This growth is primarily attributed to the expanding industrial sector and the heightened need for space cooling during intense heatwaves. As of the end of 2023, India's electricity consumption surpassed that of Japan and Korea combined, indicating a significant milestone in the global energy landscape.\n\n### Demand Projections for 2024\nLooking ahead to 2024, the Indian electricity demand is expected to rise further, with projections indicating an average annual growth rate of 6.5% over the next three years (2024-2026). This growth will be driven by several factors:\n- **Economic Activity**: The robust economic environment in India is expected to support higher electricity consumption, particularly in sectors like manufacturing and services.\n- **Electrification**: Increased electrification efforts, especially in rural areas, are contributing to the demand surge.\n- **Air Conditioning Usage**: The ownership of air conditioning units is on the rise, further straining electricity supplies during peak summer months.\n\n### Mid-Year Update for 2024\nAs of mid-2024, electricity demand growth reached 8.5% year-on-year in the first half, driven by similar factors as in previous years. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024, which correlates with rising electricity needs. The expected annual growth rate for electricity consumption in 2024 is projected at 8.2%, before tapering to around 6.8% in 2025, assuming normal weather conditions. This reflects a sustainable trend in demand that aligns with economic indicators and consumer behavior.\n\n### Per Capita Electricity Consumption\nDespite the rapid growth in electricity demand, per capita consumption in India remains relatively low compared to developed regions. Currently, per capita electricity consumption in India is approximately 20% of that in the European Union. As economic conditions improve and more households gain access to electricity and new appliances, this figure is expected to gradually increase.\n\n### Future Outlook\nThe outlook for electricity consumption in India remains positive, with renewable energy sources anticipated to meet almost half of the new demand growth. However, coal-fired generation is also expected to play a significant role in meeting the demand. This dual approach highlights the need for a balanced energy strategy that incorporates both renewable and traditional energy sources to ensure stability and sustainability in the electricity sector.\n\n### Conclusion\nIndia's electricity consumption trends from 2023 to mid-2024 illustrate a clear trajectory of growth driven by economic factors and increased electrification. Continued investment in renewable energy and infrastructure development will be crucial in meeting future demand while addressing environmental concerns.

In 2023, India experienced a remarkable 7% increase in electricity demand, a trend that is expected to continue into 2024. This growth can be attributed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid economic expansion.</li>\n<li>Increased ownership of electrical appliances, particularly air conditioners.</li>\n<li>Government initiatives aimed at expanding electrification to rural areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, Southeast Asia, which includes countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, is forecasted to see an average electricity demand growth of 5.3% from 2024 to 2026. This is supported by strong industrial activity and household electricity consumption growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Regional Comparisons</h3>\n<p>When comparing South Asia to other regions, it is evident that while Southeast Asia has surpassed Africa in per capita electricity consumption since 1995, South Asia, particularly India, is rapidly catching up.

We  expect  this  higher  trend  to continue for the remainder of the year, with annual growth averaging 8.2% in 2024, before easing moderately to 6.8% in 2025 in line with the GDP projections, and assuming normal weather conditions. The IMF forecast in their April 2024 World Economic Outlook that India's GDP growth will average 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025.

However,  recent  decades  have witnessed  a  significant  surge  in  electricity  demand  and  supply  in  India  and Southeast Asia, accompanied by rapid economic development and prosperity in these regions. Southeast Asia overtook Africa in per capita electricity consumption in  1995,  and India  achieved the same in 2008. Conversely, Africa's per capita electricity consumption has remained stagnant for more than three decades, with 2023 figures revealing it to be half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.  The  2023  per  capita  electricity  consumption  on  the  African  continent  is estimated at 530 kWh, while sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa averaged around 190 kWh. We expect per capita electricity consumption in Africa to recover to its 2010-2015 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest.\n\n## Total electricity demand (left), population (centre), and electricity consumption per capita (right) in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India, 1990-2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIEA.

Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades - which have gone hand in hand with a  boom  in  economic  development  -  have  transformed  these  regions  at  a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia.

While China remains the largest contributor to global electricity demand growth in absolute terms, India's growth rate surpasses that of many developed nations. As per the forecasts, India's electricity demand will add an equivalent amount of consumption to that of the United Kingdom within the next three years.</p>\n\n<h2>Renewable Energy and Future Projections</h2>\n<p>The growth in electricity demand in India is expected to be met through a mix of energy sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Almost half of the expected demand growth is projected to come from renewable sources, reflecting India's commitment to sustainable energy development.</li>\n<li><strong>Coal-Fired Generation:</strong> A significant portion of the growth will still be reliant on coal-fired power generation, which will account for about one-third of the demand increase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking ahead, the projections suggest that India's electricity demand will continue to grow at an average rate of 6.5% annually until 2026, underscoring the need for strategic planning in energy infrastructure to accommodate this rising demand.</p>\n\n<h2>Per Capita Electricity Consumption</h2>\n<p>Currently, India's per capita electricity consumption is approximately 20% of that in the European Union. This statistic highlights the substantial potential for growth in energy consumption as economic development continues. The increasing purchase of new appliances and improvements in living standards are likely to further elevate per capita consumption in the coming years.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In summary, India's electricity consumption is on an upward trajectory, fueled by economic growth, industrial activities, and urbanization. The anticipated demand growth presents both challenges and opportunities for sustainable energy development in India. Policymakers will need to ensure that the energy supply can meet the rising demand while also promoting renewable energy sources to achieve a balanced and sustainable energy future.</p>", 'sources': '- International Energy Agency (IEA) reports on electricity demand and consumption trends in India.\n- IMF World Economic Outlook for forecasts on GDP growth and electricity consumption.\n- Various news articles and economic analysis reports detailing electricity consumption trends in India for 2024.', 'image_path': 'https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-A5lK4x60hfnXqG1cxR9MAf5K/user-oydwKlgqC7EGEVn7K0pZcSgz/img-qCjbMeyLk2F42e3R9v1wtHqz.png?st=2025-04-01T02%3A04%3A29Z&se=2025-04-01T04%3A04%3A29Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=d505667d-d6c1-4a0a-bac7-5c84a87759f8&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-03-31T17%3A48%3A52Z&ske=2025-04-01T17%3A48%3A52Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=Ua4UV/qHuvbSpYQGG5HvxdBmc1rGBw4c4feddAIHGw4%3D'}, log='')]}
